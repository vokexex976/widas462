WEBVTT

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.290
PLANET VEGETA

00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:06.707
41 YEARS AGO

00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:35.166
Damn it!
They're crazy!

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:44.624
How rude!
They mock us with a visit like this!

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.166
Great King Cold has arrived.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.375
So it would seem.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.292
It's been too long, King Vegeta.

00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:34.750
Great King Cold, welcome.

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:39.710
Allow me to introduce my son, Frieza.

00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:46.876
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Frieza-sama.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.668
The pleasure is mine.

00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:55.584
Getting right to it,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.376
I have decided to retire.

00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:02.710
As of now, Frieza will be
taking over my forces.

00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:07.335
Put another way, the Cold force
will now be the Frieza force.

00:03:09.543 --> 00:03:11.710
Nothing will change.

00:03:11.835 --> 00:03:15.710
The Saiyans need only work according
to the Frieza force's orders.

00:03:16.377 --> 00:03:18.001
If there is any slight difference,

00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:23.460
it would be that Frieza is even
more cold-hearted than I am.

00:03:26.752 --> 00:03:27.918
Greetings.

00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:33.960
I have special expectations
from all of you Saiyans.

00:03:36.836 --> 00:03:42.168
To commemorate my installment today,
I brought you some new combat items.

00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:45.335
These are newly developed
devices called Scouters.

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:48.961
They are made more compact
than the surveillance Scout Scopes

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:52.377
that you have been using up to now,

00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:55.669
and you can also simultaneously
use them as communicators.

00:03:55.794 --> 00:04:00.253
It displays your subject's position,
battle power, and range,

00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:02.961
just as your Scopes
have done up to now.

00:04:03.086 --> 00:04:04.420
Oh...

00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:09.586
It appears that a number of Saiyans
are targeting us with weapons.

00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.336
That Saiyan hiding in there
has a battle power of...

00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:16.461
...2,000.

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:18.712
That is quite outstanding.

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:29.087
That is the gist of it.

00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:32.087
Handy, are they not?

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:39.379
For now, I will present you
with 500 units.

00:04:39.503 --> 00:04:43.628
If that is not enough, please let me know.
Goodbye, now.

00:04:53.337 --> 00:04:57.754
Ho! Look how big he is getting.

00:04:57.878 --> 00:05:00.671
My son, my pride and joy,

00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:04.170
your latent battle power
is a natural gift.

00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:11.671
It is you who will become the king
of the universe, not that monster Frieza.

00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:18.004
I look forward to seeing you grow.

00:05:25.587 --> 00:05:26.921
Who is this?

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:30.380
What is he doing in a special capsule?

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:31.754
Majesty!

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.463
This child is Broly.
He is the son of Colonel Paragus.

00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:38.796
Tell me why!
This nursery room is here

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:44.171
for exceptional babies
who will become Saiyan elites!

00:05:44.296 --> 00:05:50.130
Yes, Majesty. You see... Broly's
latent abilities are especially high.

00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:54.171
Are you telling me he has a rating
that rivals my brilliant son?

00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:56.130
Yes, Majesty.

00:05:56.255 --> 00:06:00.755
When we gauged him,
his level far exceeded the prince's.

00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:07.505
That isn't possible. The prince's own
rating was record-setting!

00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:10.339
Give me that!

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:21.839
I am terribly sorry, Majesty!
It appears to have malfunctioned.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.381
I will get a new gauge.

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:25.297
Coming right now.

00:06:26.964 --> 00:06:30.715
After further measurement,
his rating is less than half of before.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.548
He did have some anomalous
readings in the past,

00:06:34.673 --> 00:06:36.464
but they must have been
due to gauge malfunctions.

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.923
But even purging the anomalous data,

00:06:40.048 --> 00:06:42.548
Broly's latent abilities
are still substantial.

00:06:44.423 --> 00:06:48.506
Once he receives training, he will grow
to become an outstanding warrior

00:06:48.631 --> 00:06:50.423
and be a powerful asset for our forces.

00:06:50.548 --> 00:06:54.132
He could even be
the legendary Super Saiyan...

00:06:58.257 --> 00:06:59.424
Paragus-sama!
Please wait!

00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:00.715
Hey! Get away from me!
Please wait!

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.590
Please forgive my discourteousness.

00:07:07.424 --> 00:07:09.048
I understand that you plan
to launch my son Broly

00:07:09.173 --> 00:07:13.590
to an outlying world by pod?

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:15.340
That's right.

00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:18.465
That is a job for a lower-class warrior.

00:07:19.048 --> 00:07:22.465
If he develops enough
to subjugate that world,

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.257
he could become
an even stronger warrior.

00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:29.173
Dominating worlds
and selling them for a high price,

00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:32.549
that is what
the warrior Saiyan race does.

00:07:32.674 --> 00:07:35.966
His destination,
the Planetoid Vampa,

00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:40.091
is an inhospitable world
without even any people on it.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.258
I do not see how it could sell
for very much.

00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:49.508
Your son's latent abilities
are abnormally elevated.

00:07:49.632 --> 00:07:52.716
He could even be called a mutant.

00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:57.508
Someday, he will be unable
to maintain his mental state,

00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:03.425
and will be a danger not just to
my Vegeta forces, but the whole universe.

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:07.550
Be grateful that I am sending him
to another world,

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:09.091
and not just ending his life outright!

00:08:09.216 --> 00:08:11.508
How could you?

00:08:13.466 --> 00:08:19.883
You are jealous of Broly's latent abilities
which surpass the prince's,

00:08:20.008 --> 00:08:21.508
and are just trying to get rid of him!

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:24.342
Say one more word,

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:27.633
and you'll end up dead.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.925
Besides, it's already too late.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.925
The pod has just been launched.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.551
What?

00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:44.718
Move!
What are you doing?

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:50.217
Just a moment!
You don't have permission to launch!

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.009
They're not authorized!
That's dangerous!

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.968
Return here at once!
Repeat, return here at once!

00:08:57.092 --> 00:08:58.843
Please return at once!

00:08:58.968 --> 00:09:03.259
I can't do that.
I have to save my son!

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:05.968
King Vegeta boasted of how his prince,

00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:09.343
who was born at the same time,
had prodigious latent abilities.

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:15.634
He didn't like the fact that
my son Broly's abilities exceed them.

00:09:16.301 --> 00:09:20.552
The pod's destination
is some outlying planet.

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:25.260
A Planetoid called Vampa,
orbiting around Star 94.

00:09:25.843 --> 00:09:30.301
Why? There aren't any
inhabited planets in that area.

00:09:30.427 --> 00:09:34.427
The king's goal is not
to claim the planet,

00:09:34.552 --> 00:09:38.677
he means to get rid of my son Broly.

00:09:38.802 --> 00:09:41.301
Oh, my...

00:09:41.427 --> 00:09:48.094
Don't worry, Beets. Once I rescue Broly,
we'll go live on some other world.

00:09:48.218 --> 00:09:51.844
You'll drop us off there
and head back to Planet Vegeta.

00:09:51.969 --> 00:09:54.385
You aren't coming back, sir?

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.927
Of course not.
If I did, I'd just be executed.

00:09:59.052 --> 00:10:02.136
I will raise Broly to be a mighty warrior,

00:10:02.261 --> 00:10:07.010
and someday take revenge
against King Vegeta!

00:10:43.262 --> 00:10:45.429
So that's Planetoid Vampa.

00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:50.011
My calculations say that
the pod arrived here two days ago.

00:10:50.594 --> 00:10:54.845
Please be alive, Broly.
I'm coming to save you right now.

00:10:56.262 --> 00:10:57.761
He should be over there somewhere!

00:11:00.178 --> 00:11:04.053
It seemed calmer over where
there was still light. Let's land there!

00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:07.011
No, we're going in hard, here!

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.012
We have to go look for him, now!
Come with me!

00:11:15.137 --> 00:11:16.887
Me, too, sir?

00:11:17.012 --> 00:11:20.387
Yes. I can't have you taking off
on me while I'm searching.

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:23.887
I wouldn't do that.
Please trust me.

00:11:24.012 --> 00:11:28.263
Ha! Is there such a thing
as a trustworthy Saiyan?

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.929
I understand that there's a new model
of those Scout Scopes.

00:11:33.054 --> 00:11:36.138
Frieza, our new leader,
supposedly brought some with him.

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:37.762
I know.

00:11:37.887 --> 00:11:41.555
This Frieza guy is said to be
incredibly impressive.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.179
Makes no difference to me now.

00:11:47.596 --> 00:11:49.763
What could that be?

00:12:08.305 --> 00:12:09.888
What are those things?

00:12:10.013 --> 00:12:13.471
You can't be serious!
I'm not even a combatant!

00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:21.597
It looks like the night and the storms
come as a set.

00:12:21.722 --> 00:12:23.514
Now it's hot, though.

00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:27.681
Could that world be a satellite?
It's perfectly full.

00:12:27.805 --> 00:12:30.847
Don't look at it too long.
You'll become a Great Ape.

00:12:30.972 --> 00:12:35.723
Huh? Oh, right. I've never actually
turned Great Ape before.

00:12:35.848 --> 00:12:38.681
Great Apes lose all sense of themselves.

00:12:38.806 --> 00:12:42.723
The only time to become one is
if you're cornered with no other way out.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.806
What is this?

00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:51.098
The ground is soft.
This doesn't seem like grass.

00:12:55.306 --> 00:12:56.889
Those things...

00:12:57.014 --> 00:13:00.764
It looks like they're drinking
something out of the ground.

00:13:03.848 --> 00:13:05.348
What is that?

00:13:17.223 --> 00:13:20.807
That wasn't grassland,
it's a giant beast.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.265
Those monsters live
by sucking the beasts' blood.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.807
The beasts then live off
of those monsters.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:30.765
This world sure is gross...

00:13:33.141 --> 00:13:36.224
The pod! The pod is over there!

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.515
He's not here.
Where did he go?

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.224
Could he have been eaten, maybe?

00:13:48.474 --> 00:13:49.557
Over there.

00:13:57.266 --> 00:14:00.433
Are you sure this is it?

00:14:21.683 --> 00:14:23.766
Broly!

00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:28.933
You attacked a monster
and ate its leg? That's my boy!

00:14:29.058 --> 00:14:30.474
That's Broly?

00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:37.267
Battle power 920?
That's stronger than I am, you know!

00:14:37.392 --> 00:14:40.308
Even if he is a gifted child
with a high battle power,

00:14:40.434 --> 00:14:43.766
he couldn't have defeated
that monster at 920.

00:14:46.475 --> 00:14:50.350
Look here. His suit is a bit
stretched and baggy.

00:14:50.475 --> 00:14:55.183
He must have looked at that full moon
and turned Great Ape.

00:14:55.308 --> 00:14:57.642
Let's hurry and leave this world.

00:14:57.767 --> 00:14:59.892
It got pretty roughed up, huh?

00:15:01.517 --> 00:15:03.183
Oh, no!

00:15:03.308 --> 00:15:04.726
What is it?

00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:07.308
The main floater is cracked!

00:15:07.434 --> 00:15:10.017
You mean you can't fix it?

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:13.517
Absolutely not.
Without a new floater...

00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:16.767
What?
You mean we're stuck here?

00:15:16.892 --> 00:15:19.767
We can't even radio for help like this.

00:15:20.726 --> 00:15:23.351
There's enough food and water
for ten days.

00:15:23.476 --> 00:15:26.892
Do you think anyone will find us
in just ten days?

00:15:27.017 --> 00:15:32.435
We really shouldn't have
crash landed after all.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.560
This will save one person's
worth of food.

00:15:41.518 --> 00:15:43.601
FIVE YEARS LATER

00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:47.518
Bardock-San... Bardock-San!

00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:50.309
What?

00:15:50.435 --> 00:15:52.768
We're almost to Planet Vegeta.

00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:56.102
It's been a long time, huh?
Yeah.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.810
What do you suppose this is about,

00:15:58.935 --> 00:16:02.352
ordering the Saiyans to hurry
and assemble at Planet Vegeta?

00:16:02.476 --> 00:16:04.935
Apparently, that Frieza bastard
ordered it.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.977
Take off your Scouter.
They'll hear you.

00:16:07.102 --> 00:16:08.935
Ah, that's right!

00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:14.185
Look at that.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.644
All the others
are coming back home, too.

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.686
Look over there.

00:16:20.394 --> 00:16:22.644
That's Frieza's ship.

00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:25.936
There's still some time left,
but it's already standing by?

00:16:28.644 --> 00:16:30.477
You don't think it's strange?

00:16:30.602 --> 00:16:32.477
If he just wants to speak to us,

00:16:32.602 --> 00:16:36.310
he doesn't need to bring us back
to the planet, he could just use the radio.

00:16:36.436 --> 00:16:38.145
If he wants to give us new weapons,

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:40.936
there's no point in hurrying
to gather us together.

00:16:42.853 --> 00:16:46.061
There really is something fishy
going on here.

00:16:46.186 --> 00:16:49.437
Huh? What do you mean, fishy?

00:16:49.561 --> 00:16:52.437
Conquering planets and selling them

00:16:52.562 --> 00:16:56.395
has always been the livelihood
of the warrior Saiyan race.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.853
Then Frieza's father, Cold,
subjugated us by force

00:17:02.978 --> 00:17:04.478
and placed us under his rule.

00:17:05.145 --> 00:17:07.978
That was a long time ago, right?

00:17:08.103 --> 00:17:10.603
Do you think
we're getting along well now?

00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:14.395
Well, there aren't any Saiyans
that like Frieza.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.353
And Frieza likely feels
the same way about Saiyans.

00:17:20.478 --> 00:17:21.478
Huh?

00:17:21.603 --> 00:17:24.937
Right now, the Frieza force
has grown larger.

00:17:25.062 --> 00:17:29.478
They could probably get by
even without us annoying Saiyans around.

00:17:33.271 --> 00:17:38.104
You're not saying he's planning
to exterminate us, are you?

00:17:38.229 --> 00:17:41.062
I'm just saying, maybe.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.770
Oh, come on, Bardock-San.

00:17:47.854 --> 00:17:51.855
Yo, Bardock!
Made it back alive, huh?

00:17:51.979 --> 00:17:55.730
Hey, do you know the reason
for this summons order?

00:17:55.855 --> 00:18:00.688
Beats me. Maybe they found
a fairly big-league world to go after.

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:03.855
Something that will take
all of us to conquer.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.813
That's it! That's what this is.

00:18:06.938 --> 00:18:11.230
Come to think of it, the people
that report directly to Frieza

00:18:11.354 --> 00:18:13.438
were going around asking
about the Super Saiyan.

00:18:14.563 --> 00:18:18.313
The Super Saiyan?
Like in the legend?

00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:21.439
That's why!

00:18:22.896 --> 00:18:24.730
The Super Saiyan...

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:27.439
...and Super Saiyan God...

00:18:27.564 --> 00:18:31.313
We've looked into them,
but they appear to just be legends.

00:18:31.439 --> 00:18:34.480
That is about what I was thinking.

00:18:35.272 --> 00:18:40.939
I cannot afford the least bit of anxiety,
so I had to make sure.

00:18:41.063 --> 00:18:44.397
So then, are you cancelling the attack?

00:18:44.522 --> 00:18:47.439
You must be joking.

00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:50.230
Not after they
have all assembled together.

00:18:51.856 --> 00:18:57.981
This is the perfect opportunity to be rid
of them, planet and all, is it not?

00:18:59.064 --> 00:19:01.981
Welcome home, Bardock-San!
Yeah.

00:19:04.939 --> 00:19:06.856
Yo, I'm home, Gine.

00:19:06.981 --> 00:19:08.481
Huh? Bardock!

00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.356
Things sure are buzzing in town.

00:19:11.481 --> 00:19:14.231
Yeah, since everyone has come home.

00:19:14.356 --> 00:19:15.814
Where's Raditz?

00:19:15.939 --> 00:19:17.523
He's a combatant now.

00:19:17.648 --> 00:19:19.856
He's teamed with Prince Vegeta,
and they're off on some other world.

00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:22.648
They haven't come back yet, though.

00:19:22.773 --> 00:19:25.440
Prince Vegeta, huh?

00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:28.690
There's a piece of work
to be stuck with.

00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:29.815
What about Kakarot?

00:19:30.398 --> 00:19:33.107
Still in the child-rearing capsule?
Yeah.

00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:36.940
It's just about time to let him
out, though. Want to see him?

00:19:41.523 --> 00:19:42.606
He's small.

00:19:42.732 --> 00:19:45.190
He seems to be the slow-starter type.

00:19:45.315 --> 00:19:46.982
He looks just like you, though,
doesn't he?

00:19:47.107 --> 00:19:50.606
Especially your distinctive hairstyle.

00:19:54.982 --> 00:19:58.315
After dark, I'm going to go steal a pod.

00:19:58.441 --> 00:20:00.524
We're going to send him
to another world.

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:03.065
Huh? You're kidding, right?

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.691
No, I'm serious.

00:20:04.816 --> 00:20:08.274
Why would you go and do
something like that now?

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:10.149
He hasn't even learned to talk yet!

00:20:10.274 --> 00:20:15.190
With Kakarot's latent abilities,
he's destined to be sent away anyhow.

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:19.733
So, we're going to see to it
that it's at least a better planet.

00:20:19.858 --> 00:20:22.315
But it's still too soon.

00:20:24.066 --> 00:20:25.691
There may not be any time left.

00:20:25.816 --> 00:20:27.066
Time?

00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:32.774
Frieza is afraid of the legendary
Super Saiyan appearing.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:40.191
Super Saiyan?
But that's... only a fable, isn't it?

00:20:40.316 --> 00:20:45.191
Yeah. But he can't help
but be bothered by it.

00:20:45.316 --> 00:20:47.567
And he's up to no good.

00:20:49.734 --> 00:20:53.734
I get the feeling
that death is on its way.

00:20:59.525 --> 00:21:01.942
On second thought, let's not do this.

00:21:02.067 --> 00:21:03.400
Don't worry.

00:21:03.525 --> 00:21:07.233
If I turn out to be wrong,
I'll go rescue him right away.

00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:12.734
In that case, why don't the three of us
run away someplace?

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:17.151
We can't. We'd be found out
on their Scouters in no time.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:18.608
But...

00:21:19.192 --> 00:21:21.525
...why would you go to such lengths?

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.734
It's not like a Saiyan man
to worry about his children.

00:21:28.192 --> 00:21:30.401
Maybe it's because I'm always
in the middle of a battle,

00:21:30.526 --> 00:21:34.693
and I'd like to save something instead
for once.

00:21:35.317 --> 00:21:39.067
Especially someone deemed to be
a lower-class warrior,

00:21:39.192 --> 00:21:40.860
my son.

00:21:45.276 --> 00:21:48.901
I've programmed in a distant planet
named Earth.

00:21:49.026 --> 00:21:53.234
It's a world inhabited by people
with lower technology and combat levels.

00:21:54.026 --> 00:21:56.776
I think even you'll be able
to survive there.

00:21:56.901 --> 00:21:59.484
Moreover, it's not of much worth,

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:02.402
so the chances that it will be targeted
by Frieza are also low.

00:22:03.235 --> 00:22:04.776
If Bardock is overthinking the matter,

00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:08.318
we'll come
and get you right away, okay?

00:22:08.444 --> 00:22:10.609
Listen, you survive, no matter what!

00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:15.235
We'll see you later!

00:22:17.985 --> 00:22:19.152
Bye.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.944
Kakarot!

00:22:49.194 --> 00:22:53.610
Without the Saiyans,
our fighting force will be cut in half.

00:22:53.736 --> 00:22:55.819
Even at that,
we will still be able to get by.

00:22:56.486 --> 00:22:59.861
They have no choice
but to pretend to be submissive,

00:22:59.986 --> 00:23:02.069
but they may bare their fangs
at any time.

00:23:02.194 --> 00:23:03.278
Oh?

00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:08.319
They are, after all, a warrior race.

00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:13.278
One must sweep the dust away
before it can be stirred up.

00:24:21.863 --> 00:24:24.196
I feel much better now.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.321
What was that?
What's wrong?

00:24:37.447 --> 00:24:38.822
A message from the Frieza force.

00:24:38.946 --> 00:24:43.029
A meteor collided with Planet Vegeta...

00:24:43.155 --> 00:24:48.697
It was obliterated!
What?

00:24:48.822 --> 00:24:51.655
Then most of the Saiyans
were wiped out?

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.530
Why didn't they detect
the meteor approaching?

00:24:57.114 --> 00:25:02.281
We're lucky, aren't we? Ignoring
Frieza's order to gather like that?

00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:06.072
I never got to be King Vegeta.

00:25:06.197 --> 00:25:08.156
Vegeta, you have a brother, don't you?

00:25:09.114 --> 00:25:12.072
Come to think of it,
what became of him?

00:25:12.197 --> 00:25:14.531
Not that I'm interested.

00:25:15.406 --> 00:25:17.406
Raditz, you had
a younger brother, too, right?

00:25:18.614 --> 00:25:21.281
He was determined
to be a lower-class warrior,

00:25:21.406 --> 00:25:23.531
so he was
in a home child-rearing capsule.

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:26.072
Disgraceful.

00:25:26.656 --> 00:25:32.698
Hmm? My mother contacted me
saying he was sent off in a pod.

00:25:32.823 --> 00:25:34.656
It doesn't matter to me, though.

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:17.198
PRESENT DAY

00:26:30.949 --> 00:26:34.283
Mmm, delicious!

00:26:34.866 --> 00:26:39.907
Ah, the food! The air!
This cottage really is beyond terrific!

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:42.283
Right, Bulma-San?

00:26:42.408 --> 00:26:43.408
Nice, isn't it?

00:27:01.074 --> 00:27:03.700
We had it built many years ago.

00:27:03.825 --> 00:27:08.159
Out here on this unoccupied island,
1,600 kilometres south of Metro West,

00:27:08.283 --> 00:27:12.159
they can cut loose a little
and still be fine.

00:27:12.992 --> 00:27:16.700
They're likely to destroy Metro West
before long otherwise.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.658
Keep it down!

00:27:29.992 --> 00:27:32.950
Stop fighting so loud!

00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:41.992
By the way, Goku-San...

00:27:42.117 --> 00:27:45.576
Why do you seek
even greater strength?

00:27:45.701 --> 00:27:48.951
Is it because you are after
the position of Destroyer?

00:27:50.367 --> 00:27:53.242
What was that?
I can't let that slide.

00:27:53.367 --> 00:27:54.743
No, it ain't.

00:27:54.868 --> 00:27:56.868
I don't wanna be anything like that.

00:27:58.118 --> 00:28:00.076
"That" was over the line.

00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:03.576
When I saw how ridiculously strong
the guys in other universes were

00:28:03.701 --> 00:28:07.326
in that all-universe tournament earlier,

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:09.493
it got me fired...

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:11.701
...up!

00:28:11.826 --> 00:28:15.909
You mean your sights
are already set on other universes?

00:28:16.034 --> 00:28:18.493
You're as big a buffoon as ever.

00:28:18.618 --> 00:28:23.201
Then Vegeta-San, why do you seek
for even greater strength?

00:28:23.326 --> 00:28:24.410
Frieza!

00:28:25.201 --> 00:28:27.660
This idiot right here
decided to bring that devil

00:28:27.785 --> 00:28:31.076
of all people back to life, that's why!

00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:37.160
Hey, if it wasn't for Frieza,
our 7th Universe might not still be here.

00:28:37.285 --> 00:28:38.910
Oh, is that right?

00:28:39.035 --> 00:28:41.618
Yeah. He helped save us.

00:28:41.744 --> 00:28:45.952
Idiot! He was only thinking
of himself in doing so.

00:28:49.244 --> 00:28:52.202
You saw Frieza when he came
to Earth before, remember?

00:28:52.327 --> 00:28:54.910
He accomplished that much
in that short amount of time.

00:28:57.202 --> 00:29:01.161
You're saying he might get even
more powerful and come to defeat us?

00:29:01.286 --> 00:29:03.119
No doubt about it.

00:29:03.244 --> 00:29:07.952
I don't know. Even though
we brought him back to life?

00:29:08.077 --> 00:29:11.910
You idiot! Do you think
he feels obligated to us?

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:15.077
How many times
are you gonna call me an idiot?

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.619
As often as I want to, idiot!

00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:24.870
Hmm? It's Trunks.

00:29:27.745 --> 00:29:29.369
What is it?

00:29:31.287 --> 00:29:33.995
It looks like a burglar
broke into your lab.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.245
Huh? What was stolen?

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.412
I'll check the security video.

00:29:38.536 --> 00:29:39.870
Let's see...

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.620
The Dragon Balls that you collected

00:29:44.745 --> 00:29:46.370
and the Dragon Radar.

00:29:47.078 --> 00:29:50.245
They took what?

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:54.203
Like I told you, you need better security.

00:29:54.328 --> 00:29:55.787
You know what, Mama?

00:29:56.704 --> 00:29:59.287
The burglars that show up...

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.787
...they were wearing clothes
like Papa's.

00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:06.079
Huh?

00:30:10.662 --> 00:30:12.662
Thank you, Trunks.

00:30:13.787 --> 00:30:15.829
The culprits are Frieza's men.

00:30:15.954 --> 00:30:18.204
He deliberately used some men
with lower battle powers

00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:20.246
so we wouldn't notice them.

00:30:20.954 --> 00:30:24.746
Frieza sure is relentless
in going after the Dragon Balls.

00:30:25.371 --> 00:30:29.455
I wonder what sort of wish
he could have at this point.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.663
He ain't able to wish for anything
beyond Shen Long's power,

00:30:32.787 --> 00:30:36.121
so wishing to be made the strongest
in the universe is out.

00:30:36.246 --> 00:30:40.121
That should be obvious,
his wish is to never die.

00:30:40.246 --> 00:30:44.121
Yeah, but, not dying is pointless
if you still lose.

00:30:44.663 --> 00:30:49.121
Even so, there's a chance
that someday he'll surpass us!

00:30:49.246 --> 00:30:50.997
There is?

00:30:52.413 --> 00:30:56.080
I had six of the Dragon Balls.

00:30:56.204 --> 00:30:59.205
They're sure to go where
the last one is to find it.

00:30:59.329 --> 00:31:02.371
Where is it?
The ice continent.

00:31:02.496 --> 00:31:05.496
I don't like the cold,
so I was putting off going to get it.

00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:08.164
The ice continent?

00:31:08.289 --> 00:31:09.788
Would you like to come, too?

00:31:11.372 --> 00:31:12.621
I'm taking a nap.

00:31:12.747 --> 00:31:16.663
Oh, my, does that not sound like fun?

00:31:16.788 --> 00:31:18.038
Anything good to eat there?

00:31:18.164 --> 00:31:20.497
I wouldn't count on it.

00:31:20.622 --> 00:31:22.164
Then count me out.

00:31:23.247 --> 00:31:27.080
Terrific! Then here,
look after Bra.

00:31:27.205 --> 00:31:30.080
Thank you!

00:31:30.205 --> 00:31:32.748
Hey! Why, you...!

00:31:36.497 --> 00:31:39.664
The ice continent is cold.

00:31:41.706 --> 00:31:43.664
We'll have to buy
some cold-weather gear on the way.

00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:47.081
Why were you collecting
the Dragon Balls?

00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:50.831
Never you mind.

00:31:50.956 --> 00:31:53.206
Tell me!

00:31:54.497 --> 00:31:58.831
I was going to make myself younger.
About five years' worth.

00:31:58.956 --> 00:32:02.498
You were gonna use the Dragon Balls
for something that unimportant?

00:32:02.623 --> 00:32:06.749
You hush!
You Saiyans wouldn't understand!

00:32:07.707 --> 00:32:12.248
Why only five years?
Why not any longer?

00:32:12.373 --> 00:32:14.874
It would seem unnatural to become
young again all at once, right?

00:32:14.998 --> 00:32:16.665
I'm sure people would say,

00:32:17.707 --> 00:32:23.248
"Oh? Bulma-San, you suddenly
look young again, don't you?

00:32:23.373 --> 00:32:28.124
"I wonder,
have you had some work done?"

00:32:28.248 --> 00:32:29.540
And so forth.

00:32:30.082 --> 00:32:33.332
Hold on. You've already been using
the Dragon Balls from time to time, huh?

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:01.374
Frieza-sama,

00:33:01.499 --> 00:33:04.666
along with the Dragon Radar,

00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:08.708
Vegeta's wife was already in possession
of six of the Dragon Balls,

00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:11.249
so they obtained them,

00:33:11.374 --> 00:33:14.791
and they are now heading to the site
of the last one to locate it.

00:33:14.916 --> 00:33:17.499
That is marvellous news.

00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:21.750
So, shall we start up the ship
and head for Earth?

00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:26.375
No, we can do that once they find
all seven Dragon Balls.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.708
It would be dangerous to rush there
and arrive too early.

00:33:29.833 --> 00:33:35.208
Even without Scouters, they can tell
if a high battle power is approaching.

00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:38.958
Understood.

00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:43.000
You have written down
how to make the wish, yes?

00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:45.250
Yes, to the letter.

00:33:45.375 --> 00:33:47.709
By the way...

00:33:47.834 --> 00:33:49.333
What is it, Kikono?

00:33:49.459 --> 00:33:55.709
Nothing... just... once
the Dragon Balls are gathered,

00:33:55.834 --> 00:34:01.084
I was wondering, Frieza-sama,
what sort of wish would you be making?

00:34:01.209 --> 00:34:05.251
Would it be to have an immortal body,
as you have mentioned before?

00:34:07.042 --> 00:34:09.251
No, it would not.
Huh?

00:34:10.709 --> 00:34:12.876
I realised something
when I was in Earth's hell

00:34:13.001 --> 00:34:15.418
and rendered unable to move

00:34:15.543 --> 00:34:20.168
that not being able to either die or move
was nothing but misery.

00:34:20.293 --> 00:34:23.792
Then... perhaps,

00:34:23.917 --> 00:34:28.626
to not ever take any damage...
or something?

00:34:29.877 --> 00:34:32.668
That would make the game
no fun to play.

00:34:34.334 --> 00:34:38.626
Hmm... What could it be?

00:34:40.127 --> 00:34:41.460
You will never guess.

00:34:41.585 --> 00:34:45.877
You wish to increase
your height, correct?

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.918
Huh? Berryblue-San!
How could you say that?

00:34:51.043 --> 00:34:53.460
There are so many soldiers
who have called Frieza-sama

00:34:53.585 --> 00:34:59.377
a "pipsqueak" behind his back
who have been eliminated, after all.

00:34:59.502 --> 00:35:02.918
Well deduced, Berryblue-San.

00:35:03.043 --> 00:35:04.377
You are correct.

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.002
Huh?

00:35:07.002 --> 00:35:08.753
That was the right answer?

00:35:08.877 --> 00:35:11.918
Can you promise not to tell anyone?

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:14.586
Of course!

00:35:15.544 --> 00:35:17.377
I would like...

00:35:18.294 --> 00:35:21.961
...to grow by about five centimetres.

00:35:22.085 --> 00:35:23.919
Huh?

00:35:24.377 --> 00:35:29.544
Then, if you adopted
your second transformation,

00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:32.044
would that not be sufficiently tall?

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:38.378
Oh, no! I wish to be taller
in my regular and final forms.

00:35:38.502 --> 00:35:43.211
Then, why only a mere five centimetres?

00:35:43.336 --> 00:35:50.836
It would seem unnatural to become
tall all at once, right?

00:35:50.961 --> 00:35:54.378
I want it to look like I am still growing.

00:35:54.503 --> 00:35:59.712
I see...

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.253
There's nobody around here.

00:36:09.378 --> 00:36:14.920
There just aren't that many folks
with a battle power of at least 1,000.

00:36:15.045 --> 00:36:16.545
What choice do we have?

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:20.254
Our orders were to go find
as many combatants as we could

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:21.712
to rebuild the force.

00:36:21.837 --> 00:36:24.045
There already were a bunch
of combatants, weren't there?

00:36:24.171 --> 00:36:26.879
Rumour has it that they were
fighting too timidly,

00:36:27.004 --> 00:36:29.463
so Frieza-sama killed them all.

00:36:32.087 --> 00:36:35.712
Cheelai, why did you join
the Frieza force?

00:36:35.837 --> 00:36:39.671
It got out that I stole
a Galactic Patrol spaceship.

00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:42.421
They can't touch me
if I'm in the Frieza force, right?

00:36:42.546 --> 00:36:44.379
You're scum.

00:36:44.504 --> 00:36:46.212
Yeah, well...

00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:49.504
Lemo-San, you've been in the Frieza
force the whole time, right?

00:36:49.629 --> 00:36:51.838
Have you ever met Frieza-sama?

00:36:51.963 --> 00:36:56.005
I'm not a combatant.
I've only ever seen him on the station.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.713
I hear he's teeny.

00:36:59.088 --> 00:37:03.921
Don't ever say anything like that again.
Not if you want to live.

00:37:04.046 --> 00:37:05.379
All right.

00:37:05.504 --> 00:37:08.963
He's killed some people before
just for having bad breath.

00:37:09.088 --> 00:37:12.172
Still, if he's putting women
and old men to work,

00:37:12.297 --> 00:37:15.547
the Frieza force might have
just about had it, huh?

00:37:17.172 --> 00:37:18.755
What's that?

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.297
A distress signal!

00:37:20.422 --> 00:37:24.088
What's more, it's an awfully
old type of Frieza force signal.

00:37:24.213 --> 00:37:25.630
It's coming from that world over there.

00:37:25.756 --> 00:37:29.088
If we rescue them,
we may get a special bonus.

00:37:30.046 --> 00:37:32.630
All right, let's get down there!

00:37:39.505 --> 00:37:42.047
There's no one here.
There, you see?

00:37:42.172 --> 00:37:44.255
I'll try using my Scouter.

00:37:48.173 --> 00:37:49.797
Are you the Frieza force?

00:37:57.089 --> 00:38:02.089
Is that a tail?
You mean, you're a Saiyan?

00:38:02.214 --> 00:38:03.214
"Saiyan"?

00:38:05.047 --> 00:38:09.381
Yeah. I'm Paragus.
I'm a Frieza force Saiyan.

00:38:09.506 --> 00:38:11.715
So that distress signal...

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:15.256
Yeah, that was me.
My spaceship broke down.

00:38:16.506 --> 00:38:23.798
I've waited an unbelievably long time,
and now, I'm saved!

00:38:24.465 --> 00:38:27.757
Battle power 4,200. Great.

00:38:27.882 --> 00:38:29.339
Are you alone?

00:38:29.465 --> 00:38:30.965
No, there's one other...

00:38:37.548 --> 00:38:39.299
Broly!

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.257
This is my son, Broly.

00:38:59.716 --> 00:39:02.674
No way!
What?

00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:07.299
His battle power is... beyond measure!

00:39:07.424 --> 00:39:11.549
Hmm? Ridiculous.
That's not possible...

00:39:13.674 --> 00:39:16.924
Hop in! Frieza-sama will be delighted!

00:39:22.549 --> 00:39:26.632
Let's see...
What was your name again?

00:39:26.758 --> 00:39:28.258
Broly.

00:39:29.425 --> 00:39:31.550
You want one of these, Broly?

00:39:31.674 --> 00:39:35.091
They're good. Here.

00:39:38.091 --> 00:39:40.592
You have to unwrap it first!

00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:46.592
Eat it, Broly.

00:39:53.258 --> 00:39:54.759
Well? It's good, right?

00:39:56.508 --> 00:39:59.341
What, not even a thank you?

00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:01.467
Tell her thanks, Broly.

00:40:02.425 --> 00:40:04.884
Thank you... very much.

00:40:05.009 --> 00:40:08.425
That's formal.
Just "thank you" is fine.

00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:12.176
Thank you?

00:40:12.842 --> 00:40:14.092
Sure!

00:40:17.092 --> 00:40:20.092
I have brought them, Frieza-sama.

00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:21.717
Oh...

00:40:23.342 --> 00:40:26.760
Are you really a Saiyan?

00:40:30.134 --> 00:40:32.009
You do not appear to have a tail.

00:40:32.134 --> 00:40:33.384
No, sir.

00:40:33.509 --> 00:40:38.010
The effects of transforming
into a Great Ape, which is a Saiyan trait,

00:40:38.134 --> 00:40:41.051
caused him to lose all sense of himself.

00:40:41.176 --> 00:40:43.093
Which is why I cut off his tail.

00:40:43.217 --> 00:40:47.301
Has he lost his sense of himself since?

00:40:47.426 --> 00:40:49.177
Yes, sir, on rare occasions.

00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:53.135
So you are saying that it does
sometimes still happen?

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.843
Please do not worry.
When that happens...

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.343
...using this remote control, electricity
runs through the device around Broly's neck.

00:41:02.469 --> 00:41:06.302
It is not a strong current,
but it allows me to control him.

00:41:06.427 --> 00:41:07.885
I see.

00:41:10.218 --> 00:41:11.719
What is your name?

00:41:15.844 --> 00:41:18.177
It is Broly, sir.

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:24.011
I see you still have a tremendous level
of yet-untapped battle power.

00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:29.719
I am certain that he can be
of great use to you, Frieza-sama.

00:41:30.343 --> 00:41:33.343
This is indeed an unexpected bounty.

00:41:33.469 --> 00:41:38.052
Berryblue-San, please offer a reward
to the two who found him.

00:41:41.052 --> 00:41:42.552
This much?

00:41:43.052 --> 00:41:46.094
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!

00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:49.052
I understand that you were unable
to escape from that barren planet

00:41:49.178 --> 00:41:51.636
for quite a long time.

00:41:51.761 --> 00:41:52.761
Yes, sir.

00:41:52.886 --> 00:41:59.762
Are you aware that your home world
of Planet Vegeta is no longer there?

00:41:59.886 --> 00:42:06.636
Yes, sir. I heard so on the way here.
But none of that matters now.

00:42:06.762 --> 00:42:07.845
It's just...

00:42:08.428 --> 00:42:10.553
Vengeance, yes?

00:42:13.303 --> 00:42:19.428
Paragus-San, did you know
that King Vegeta's son, Vegeta IV,

00:42:19.553 --> 00:42:20.970
is still alive?

00:42:22.095 --> 00:42:23.595
What?

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.553
Prince Vegeta?

00:42:25.678 --> 00:42:29.387
Why... that miserable Vegeta!

00:42:30.636 --> 00:42:34.262
Allow me to lend you some assistance
with your vengeance.

00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:39.179
Berryblue-San, once these two
have had a shower,

00:42:39.304 --> 00:42:42.262
please arrange for some
battle uniforms for them.

00:42:43.512 --> 00:42:44.679
Yes, sir.

00:42:48.012 --> 00:42:52.888
I had not meant to fight this time,
but now...

00:42:53.596 --> 00:42:57.096
This is starting to get interesting.

00:43:04.721 --> 00:43:06.054
Yo!

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.096
You're looking freshly scrubbed,
aren't you?

00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:09.637
Come eat with us.

00:43:09.763 --> 00:43:12.846
Broly, where's your battle uniform?

00:43:12.971 --> 00:43:15.637
It's... hard to move in it.

00:43:16.472 --> 00:43:18.346
It's not once you put it on.

00:43:18.472 --> 00:43:21.555
Do whatever you like, though.

00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:24.846
But get rid of that fur around your waist.

00:43:24.971 --> 00:43:27.096
It's dirty, and it stinks.

00:43:27.221 --> 00:43:28.971
No!

00:43:32.305 --> 00:43:36.221
Oh, so it's something important to you.

00:43:39.764 --> 00:43:41.847
This... is my...

00:43:41.972 --> 00:43:44.555
Broly, we're here to eat,

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.764
not to talk.

00:43:49.555 --> 00:43:52.014
You can at least let him
talk that much, can't you?

00:43:52.139 --> 00:43:54.472
I'd appreciate it if you didn't butt in.

00:43:55.264 --> 00:43:56.264
Huh?

00:43:56.389 --> 00:43:57.389
Now, now...

00:43:57.513 --> 00:44:00.389
Hey, are you new?

00:44:02.638 --> 00:44:06.347
It can't be any fun hanging out
with this sour bunch.

00:44:06.473 --> 00:44:09.847
I'm the only combatant aboard
this ship for this operation

00:44:09.972 --> 00:44:12.639
who's any good.

00:44:13.473 --> 00:44:15.055
Come on over with me.

00:44:15.181 --> 00:44:17.681
Let go of me!
I told you no, didn't I?

00:44:18.848 --> 00:44:21.598
How about if I buy you a drink?

00:44:21.723 --> 00:44:23.347
Shut up, old man!

00:44:26.514 --> 00:44:27.514
Stop, Broly!

00:44:27.639 --> 00:44:30.598
What do you want?
You got a problem with me?

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.140
I do.

00:44:34.264 --> 00:44:37.056
What did you say?

00:44:37.182 --> 00:44:41.140
What? Damn it! Damn it!

00:44:41.265 --> 00:44:42.765
Broly!

00:45:08.515 --> 00:45:10.098
Are you okay?

00:45:11.515 --> 00:45:13.766
You! You went too far!

00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:15.724
How could you do that to him?

00:45:15.849 --> 00:45:18.807
If I hadn't stopped him,
he might have killed him.

00:45:18.932 --> 00:45:22.682
Just how did you raise him?

00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:26.349
While we are in your debt,
we don't seem to see eye to eye.

00:45:26.474 --> 00:45:30.433
From now on, please do not
come near my son.

00:45:34.807 --> 00:45:38.641
Paragus-San, Frieza-sama
is calling for you.

00:45:38.766 --> 00:45:42.183
Frieza-sama? Yes, we will
come right away. Broly!

00:45:42.308 --> 00:45:44.932
No, just you, Paragus-San.

00:45:45.433 --> 00:45:47.767
Huh? Oh, I see.

00:45:47.891 --> 00:45:50.892
Broly, I'll be right back. Wait here.

00:45:52.057 --> 00:45:57.099
My dead creep of a father
might be better than this guy.

00:45:57.224 --> 00:45:58.725
Huh?

00:46:02.266 --> 00:46:03.808
Oh, you swiped that?

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.433
This is what I think of this thing!

00:46:11.975 --> 00:46:15.142
Broly, thank you for earlier.

00:46:20.892 --> 00:46:24.309
Oh, you want some water?
Let me have that.

00:46:28.017 --> 00:46:29.017
Here.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.267
What is this?

00:46:37.392 --> 00:46:39.350
Huh? It's ordinary water.

00:46:39.476 --> 00:46:42.726
Haven't you ever had water before?

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.809
That was good.

00:46:57.185 --> 00:47:00.059
This is Ba's ear.

00:47:00.559 --> 00:47:02.518
Oh, you mean the fur?

00:47:03.018 --> 00:47:06.185
Me and Ba got along well.

00:47:07.018 --> 00:47:11.768
Ba is a big, big, beast,
bigger than this ship.

00:47:11.893 --> 00:47:14.893
"Ba" is the sound Ba made,
so that's what I called Ba.

00:47:16.101 --> 00:47:17.435
Ba was scary,

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:22.977
but day after day, while doing
training by dodging Ba's attacks,

00:47:24.351 --> 00:47:25.977
we became friends.

00:47:26.852 --> 00:47:28.643
We became good friends.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.685
So Ba was the first friend
you ever made.

00:47:39.269 --> 00:47:42.102
But Dad was angry.

00:47:42.227 --> 00:47:46.727
Being friends with Ba isn't training.
So then...

00:47:48.769 --> 00:47:53.478
...Dad shot Ba's ear with a gun,
making Ba angry.

00:47:54.019 --> 00:47:58.436
Ba never became friends
with me again.

00:47:58.561 --> 00:48:04.269
That's why I decided to stay
with Ba's ear.

00:48:06.728 --> 00:48:08.728
You sure talked a lot, Broly.

00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:13.853
This is the first time I've ever heard
such a pure story around here.

00:48:13.978 --> 00:48:16.936
You seriously are innocent.

00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:21.603
I'll bet you don't even like to fight,
do you?

00:48:22.728 --> 00:48:25.978
You just had an incredible gift
for rough-and-tumble fighting,

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:29.603
so your old man forced you
to train, didn't he?

00:48:29.728 --> 00:48:31.061
That father of yours!

00:48:31.895 --> 00:48:36.145
He only thinks of you
as a powerful weapon, doesn't he?

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:38.103
One used for vengeance
and getting ahead.

00:48:38.686 --> 00:48:42.437
Probably.
Your old man is the worst.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.687
You don't have to do everything
that guy tells you.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.228
It's not right for you
to say bad things about Dad.

00:48:58.771 --> 00:49:00.353
It should be around here somewhere...

00:49:02.771 --> 00:49:05.188
You idiot!
Hurry and pull me up!

00:49:05.312 --> 00:49:07.146
Sorry!

00:49:14.146 --> 00:49:15.937
Found it! I found it!

00:49:18.771 --> 00:49:21.188
The planet called Earth
to which we are about to go

00:49:21.313 --> 00:49:24.188
will have Vegeta
and one other Saiyan.

00:49:24.313 --> 00:49:27.396
I would like to see Broly-san's power.

00:49:27.979 --> 00:49:31.646
The innate strength that Broly possesses
is super-prodigious.

00:49:31.772 --> 00:49:33.855
We will achieve
our long-sought vengeance!

00:49:34.605 --> 00:49:38.480
Incidentally, you are free to do
with Vegeta whatever you wish.

00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:45.813
But please allow me to finish off
the other Saiyan named Son Goku.

00:49:46.396 --> 00:49:51.688
Killing Son Goku has long been
a dream of mine, you see!

00:49:53.063 --> 00:49:54.772
As you wish.

00:49:54.897 --> 00:49:58.897
Frieza-sama, we have collected
all seven Dragon Balls!

00:49:59.022 --> 00:50:01.063
Oh, that is outstanding!

00:50:13.439 --> 00:50:15.105
Down there! Frieza's men!

00:50:15.689 --> 00:50:18.355
They've already found the last one?

00:50:20.355 --> 00:50:22.272
That aircraft looks like trouble,
doesn't it?

00:50:22.898 --> 00:50:25.564
Could those be the Saiyans
that Kikono-sama warned us about?

00:50:28.439 --> 00:50:30.647
Whoo! Now this is cold!

00:50:31.272 --> 00:50:33.355
Whis-San, I'm surprised
it doesn't bother you.

00:50:33.481 --> 00:50:36.190
The vacuum of space is even colder.

00:50:39.773 --> 00:50:40.773
Yikes!

00:50:40.898 --> 00:50:44.731
The Scouter's readings just spiked!
It's the Saiyans!

00:50:44.856 --> 00:50:47.273
We're getting out of here!

00:50:56.565 --> 00:50:59.732
Hey, you! Come on out
and give back the Dragon Balls!

00:51:01.732 --> 00:51:03.064
What do we do?

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:09.023
What do we do?
If we don't give them back, he'll kill us.

00:51:09.982 --> 00:51:14.315
If we do give them back,
Frieza-sama will kill us!

00:51:35.316 --> 00:51:38.316
Well, well,
here comes Frieza's entrance.

00:51:38.441 --> 00:51:40.357
Hmm? What's that?

00:51:41.441 --> 00:51:43.399
It ain't just Frieza.

00:51:43.524 --> 00:51:47.441
There's some other
out-of-this-world guy in there.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.025
Those are Saiyans, aren't they?

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:27.442
Vegeta! There's no doubt about it.

00:52:30.734 --> 00:52:32.358
He looks just like the king.

00:52:36.525 --> 00:52:38.609
What are you doing here, Frieza?

00:52:38.734 --> 00:52:41.233
I am sure you already know.

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:44.317
Having a wish granted
by the Dragon Balls.

00:52:49.442 --> 00:52:51.442
What are those ball-like things?

00:52:51.567 --> 00:52:54.442
Beats me.
Go ask someone.

00:52:55.151 --> 00:52:58.859
Hey! Go get the Dragon Balls back!

00:52:58.984 --> 00:53:01.525
It appears
that we have a larger problem.

00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:06.151
I suppose you might call it
the nature of their warrior race.

00:53:06.276 --> 00:53:08.485
Frieza, who are those two?

00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:12.067
These are the newest enlistees
to the Frieza force,

00:53:12.193 --> 00:53:15.234
Broly-San and his father...

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.193
Paragus!

00:53:17.318 --> 00:53:23.193
There you have it. As you appear to have
noticed, they, like you, are Saiyans.

00:53:23.318 --> 00:53:24.735
I don't know them.

00:53:25.318 --> 00:53:29.027
I understand that when you were
quite little, your father, King Vegeta,

00:53:29.151 --> 00:53:33.777
did a terrible disservice
to Paragus-San and Broly-San here,

00:53:33.902 --> 00:53:40.152
and up until now, they were trapped
on an unfamiliar, inimical world.

00:53:45.902 --> 00:53:47.402
Frieza!

00:53:49.777 --> 00:53:51.693
What's "inimical"?

00:53:54.569 --> 00:53:56.652
It means "beyond severe".

00:53:57.985 --> 00:54:00.152
Thanks.
You idiot!

00:54:01.818 --> 00:54:05.569
I swear that you, at least,
will pay for that, Vegeta!

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.527
We are here to take revenge!

00:54:11.527 --> 00:54:14.194
Don't be ridiculous!
How is that any of my affair?

00:54:14.319 --> 00:54:15.986
He ain't got nothing to do with that!

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.069
We're all Saiyans here.

00:54:18.194 --> 00:54:20.194
Let's just get along.

00:54:24.278 --> 00:54:25.903
Frieza-sama?

00:54:29.903 --> 00:54:32.903
He appears unable to wait.
Very well.

00:54:33.028 --> 00:54:36.819
Please show me what he has.

00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:39.361
Understood, sir.

00:54:39.487 --> 00:54:40.652
All right! Broly!

00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:42.361
Do it!

00:55:04.445 --> 00:55:07.779
You're not bad, huh?
I'm finally starting to warm up!

00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:23.154
He's fast!

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:27.154
He must have studied
how to use his power.

00:55:32.279 --> 00:55:35.696
It looks like Vegeta
is fairly well-trained, too.

00:55:35.821 --> 00:55:39.112
They have been through
their own share of battles, after all.

00:55:40.321 --> 00:55:43.780
Moreover, your son seems
yet unaccustomed to this.

00:55:43.905 --> 00:55:47.571
Broly-San has never fought
another person, correct?

00:55:47.696 --> 00:55:49.863
Only simulated fights with me.

00:55:49.988 --> 00:55:55.488
Fighting against someone of your
battle power is all but meaningless.

00:55:55.613 --> 00:55:57.238
Not to worry.

00:55:57.362 --> 00:55:59.363
He is steadily becoming
more familiar with it.

00:56:12.363 --> 00:56:13.863
Good, Broly!

00:56:24.946 --> 00:56:26.197
You're a real pest!

00:56:56.281 --> 00:56:58.531
What is that?

00:56:59.156 --> 00:57:03.989
Oh, is Broly-San not able
to turn Super Saiyan?

00:57:04.531 --> 00:57:08.239
Super Saiyan? You don't mean...

00:57:08.989 --> 00:57:10.823
...like the legend?

00:57:42.365 --> 00:57:44.199
What's with this guy?

00:57:50.865 --> 00:57:52.491
He's quick to develop!

00:58:12.241 --> 00:58:16.616
He's awesome! He's starting
to hold his own in his base form!

00:59:09.493 --> 00:59:13.742
I never imagined that Vegeta
had improved so much.

00:59:13.867 --> 00:59:15.909
Oh, has he reached his limit already?

00:59:16.034 --> 00:59:18.534
Yes, sir.

00:59:19.326 --> 00:59:21.075
Oh, very well.

00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:24.451
Perhaps we should call it a day.

00:59:24.576 --> 00:59:25.659
Yes, sir.

00:59:31.159 --> 00:59:32.576
What is this?

00:59:35.826 --> 00:59:39.951
No! Broly!
That's enough for now!

00:59:40.576 --> 00:59:43.868
Stop! Come back!

00:59:51.701 --> 00:59:53.452
It's gone!

00:59:54.076 --> 00:59:57.619
My remote control is gone!
Oh, no!

00:59:57.743 --> 01:00:02.327
Broly! I told you to stop!

01:00:05.826 --> 01:00:08.993
Didn't you hear what I said?

01:00:12.911 --> 01:00:14.952
This is worthless.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.118
Stop, Vegeta!

01:01:13.661 --> 01:01:15.661
No way... What?

01:01:16.745 --> 01:01:18.578
Have you ever seen a Saiyan
like this before?

01:01:18.703 --> 01:01:22.287
Hey, did you bring
any Senzu beans, Kakarot?

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.496
No, I didn't!

01:01:24.953 --> 01:01:27.162
This is no time to be playing around.

01:01:53.038 --> 01:01:55.913
If that had hit the ground...

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.371
Vegeta!

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:15.455
What is that?

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.954
That...?

01:02:17.079 --> 01:02:20.663
He seems to have become able
to transform and take on the power

01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:23.622
that Saiyans have
when becoming Great Apes,

01:02:23.747 --> 01:02:28.705
without a Great Ape's lumbering moves,
by remaining in his humanoid form.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.455
Is there some issue with it?

01:02:31.121 --> 01:02:32.622
The thing is...

01:02:35.455 --> 01:02:39.413
...he cannot even control it himself.

01:02:52.247 --> 01:02:53.789
Hey, you!

01:02:57.830 --> 01:03:00.705
I think it's about time you fought me.

01:05:56.626 --> 01:05:58.126
Hey, calm down!

01:06:14.835 --> 01:06:18.877
We all live in peace
here on the Earth!

01:06:25.251 --> 01:06:28.585
Well, a lot... has happened,
but still...

01:06:35.002 --> 01:06:37.211
Whatever the case,
you ain't a bad guy.

01:06:37.336 --> 01:06:39.127
I can tell.

01:06:41.377 --> 01:06:45.752
Stop doing this. You don't have to listen
to what those bad guys say.

01:07:25.836 --> 01:07:28.961
Frieza-sama, is it okay
if we back off a little?

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.045
That would seem to be for the best.

01:07:35.878 --> 01:07:40.212
We will take charge
of the Dragon Balls!

01:07:42.587 --> 01:07:49.004
We are now free to watch
your son's exploits without reservation.

01:08:14.379 --> 01:08:17.712
That guy is that phenomenal?

01:08:18.379 --> 01:08:19.962
Still, this...

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:22.046
...isn't right.

01:08:22.171 --> 01:08:23.171
Yeah.

01:08:28.004 --> 01:08:29.671
It's because of his old man.

01:08:30.755 --> 01:08:31.838
Yeah.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.963
This is the result of him
taking that sweet Broly

01:08:37.088 --> 01:08:40.880
and raising him to be the kind of warrior
that he wants him to be.

01:08:41.379 --> 01:08:43.713
And now he's snapped.

01:08:46.297 --> 01:08:48.214
I really feel sorry for the guy.

01:08:52.713 --> 01:08:54.505
Oh, if this keeps up...

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:58.506
...my Broly will be killed!

01:08:59.297 --> 01:09:02.422
Oh, it's all over!

01:10:19.299 --> 01:10:24.882
Well, well, it appears the great
Frieza-sama may not get a chance.

01:10:33.424 --> 01:10:35.049
Son!

01:10:36.882 --> 01:10:38.132
What's happened?

01:10:38.257 --> 01:10:40.633
That isn't just Frieza's Ki.

01:10:41.633 --> 01:10:44.466
Yeah, you're right...

01:10:44.591 --> 01:10:46.758
Sounds like you have your hands full.

01:10:48.883 --> 01:10:51.382
You got that right.

01:10:51.966 --> 01:10:53.591
It's a tremendous Ki.

01:10:54.257 --> 01:10:57.716
Even if I went there,
I'd just be in the way.

01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:01.341
Just stand by there for me.

01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:09.091
If things get out of hand, I'll use
Instantaneous Movement to head there.

01:11:17.175 --> 01:11:21.175
If you're saying something like that,
this must be some foe, all right.

01:11:24.425 --> 01:11:26.050
Later.

01:13:19.677 --> 01:13:24.261
Perhaps what King Vegeta said...

01:13:25.094 --> 01:13:27.470
...was true.

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:45.220
Are you sure that he really has
nothing more this time?

01:13:45.345 --> 01:13:46.345
Yes, sir...

01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:48.720
I see.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.261
Shall we put that to the test?

01:14:02.762 --> 01:14:04.553
Ahem.

01:14:04.678 --> 01:14:07.970
Broly-San! Look at this!

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:10.970
Broly-San!

01:14:11.095 --> 01:14:15.262
Your father has been killed!

01:15:07.555 --> 01:15:10.597
Yes! I succeeded!

01:15:57.889 --> 01:15:59.306
Very nice.

01:15:59.431 --> 01:16:01.640
That was the expression
I was waiting for.

01:16:03.723 --> 01:16:05.765
What are you dawdling around for?

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:07.598
Idiot!

01:16:10.681 --> 01:16:12.932
This is no time to insist
on fighting one-on-one, right?

01:16:13.057 --> 01:16:15.932
I hate to admit it,
but it looks like you're right.

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:32.723
Let's go, Vegeta!

01:16:34.224 --> 01:16:36.182
Damn it all!

01:16:36.307 --> 01:16:37.307
Gyallic Ho!

01:16:37.432 --> 01:16:39.516
Kamehame...

01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:40.848
Ha!

01:16:52.974 --> 01:16:56.099
Just a moment! I am Frieza!

01:17:01.933 --> 01:17:03.974
Vegeta! Now! Over here!

01:17:04.099 --> 01:17:05.183
What?

01:17:09.099 --> 01:17:11.557
Hey, what in the world is going on?

01:17:14.517 --> 01:17:15.599
Let go of me!

01:17:15.724 --> 01:17:17.308
Hurry! I'll explain later.

01:17:18.308 --> 01:17:20.350
Piccolo. Got any Senzu?

01:17:20.475 --> 01:17:21.849
No, I don't.

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:26.308
Hey, Vegeta,

01:17:27.183 --> 01:17:28.725
do you know the technique
called Fusion?

01:17:28.849 --> 01:17:34.558
Fusion? Yeah, now that you mention it,
Trunks said something about it.

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:37.809
Hmm? That technique where you do
absurd moves and merge together?

01:17:37.934 --> 01:17:41.141
Yeah, we're gonna do "Fu-sion"!

01:17:41.266 --> 01:17:42.433
Don't be ridiculous!

01:17:42.558 --> 01:17:45.017
As if I'd ever merge myself... with you!

01:17:45.142 --> 01:17:47.809
It's just for 30 minutes!

01:17:47.934 --> 01:17:50.267
We've joined together before
with the potara earrings, didn't we?

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:55.683
We ain't got potaras here,
so Fusion is the only way to beat him!

01:17:55.809 --> 01:17:58.226
Even if we have no choice
but to merge together

01:17:58.351 --> 01:18:02.184
are you telling me to do these,
these, and these moves?

01:18:02.309 --> 01:18:07.059
It's the only way to win!
The Earth could be done for!

01:18:07.184 --> 01:18:09.476
Then that's just fate.

01:18:11.351 --> 01:18:14.810
You're okay with letting
your beloved Bulma die?

01:18:16.309 --> 01:18:19.810
Don't try to embarrass me into it!

01:18:20.559 --> 01:18:23.351
All right.
Hurry up and teach it to me!

01:18:41.435 --> 01:18:43.101
You dare to push me...

01:18:43.935 --> 01:18:46.310
...to these lengths, do you?

01:18:47.018 --> 01:18:53.851
Then I will teach you a lesson
in the force of Golden Frieza!

01:18:53.976 --> 01:18:56.560
Fu... sion!

01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:01.143
What an embarrassing pose!

01:19:01.268 --> 01:19:05.685
This is Fusion. We ain't got any time.
Come on, let's practice!

01:19:05.811 --> 01:19:08.852
What's wrong, Vegeta?

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:11.477
I'd rather be dead...

01:19:13.435 --> 01:19:16.102
Fu... sion!

01:19:32.644 --> 01:19:34.811
Nobody's stronger than me now!

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.977
No good! Your fingers didn't match up!

01:19:37.102 --> 01:19:39.520
Try it again in 30 minutes!

01:19:48.311 --> 01:19:51.144
Fu... sion!

01:19:57.144 --> 01:19:58.895
Absolutely wrong!

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.145
Your two angles were slightly off!

01:20:01.269 --> 01:20:03.478
Another 30 minutes!

01:20:07.812 --> 01:20:10.978
Fu... sion!

01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:36.187
Good! Now, get out there
and defeat him...

01:20:36.312 --> 01:20:39.021
What do I call you?
Huh?

01:20:39.145 --> 01:20:42.437
Using potaras,
it was "Vegetto", wasn't it?

01:20:42.562 --> 01:20:43.979
Okay then...

01:20:44.104 --> 01:20:46.354
Forget it! Hurry and go!

01:20:46.479 --> 01:20:50.854
I can't do that. Having a name
would sound cooler, to be sure.

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:54.687
This time it'll be...

01:20:55.271 --> 01:20:57.104
...Gogeta!

01:21:07.687 --> 01:21:08.896
Wonderful!

01:21:09.021 --> 01:21:12.605
What wonderful battle power!

01:21:14.188 --> 01:21:15.522
Who are you?

01:21:16.896 --> 01:21:18.188
I am Gogeta!

01:21:19.146 --> 01:21:21.939
Goku and Vegeta have merged together!

01:21:22.063 --> 01:21:23.438
Merged?

01:21:23.563 --> 01:21:27.730
You've been dead for a long time,
so you wouldn't know.

01:21:27.855 --> 01:21:30.313
Their two strengths
are not just added together,

01:21:30.438 --> 01:21:32.563
they're significantly greater.

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:34.772
That is not fair!

01:21:35.647 --> 01:21:39.022
You're a fine one to be saying that.

01:21:44.314 --> 01:21:45.730
Over here!

01:21:49.022 --> 01:21:50.022
Oh, my.

01:21:50.147 --> 01:21:52.314
Whis-San, let me take it from here!

01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:57.314
You two can merge together, I see.

01:21:57.439 --> 01:21:59.689
Ah, it's that Fusion thing!

01:22:04.564 --> 01:22:05.815
Come on!

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.940
Now it's my turn!

01:24:47.526 --> 01:24:51.109
Broly is going to be finished
at this rate!

01:24:51.235 --> 01:24:55.360
He's been turned into nothing but a
fighting machine, thanks to his father.

01:24:55.485 --> 01:24:58.943
He isn't fighting
because he wants to fight!

01:24:59.068 --> 01:25:03.193
Broly is actually
a pure, kind-hearted Saiyan!

01:25:03.318 --> 01:25:05.151
We can't let him die!

01:26:20.278 --> 01:26:24.445
I shall grant thee any one wish.

01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:26.570
So, now what do we do?

01:26:27.237 --> 01:26:29.237
Hurry up and tell me!

01:26:30.195 --> 01:26:31.612
Forget it, I'm shooting.

01:26:31.737 --> 01:26:34.570
All right! I'll tell you!

01:26:35.986 --> 01:26:38.779
"Just say the wish as is."

01:26:38.904 --> 01:26:41.987
Oh, is that all?

01:26:44.487 --> 01:26:45.987
My wish is...

01:28:18.364 --> 01:28:20.280
Magnificent!

01:28:21.073 --> 01:28:25.198
This might bring this to a close.

01:28:30.031 --> 01:28:32.156
Ka...

01:28:32.281 --> 01:28:34.531
...me...

01:28:34.656 --> 01:28:36.739
...ha...

01:28:36.864 --> 01:28:38.365
...me...

01:28:53.281 --> 01:28:58.657
Send Broly back to the planet
where he was before!

01:29:20.407 --> 01:29:22.907
Your wish has been granted.

01:29:24.865 --> 01:29:26.698
Farewell!

01:29:43.491 --> 01:29:44.783
Get in, Cheelai!

01:29:58.075 --> 01:29:59.325
Whoa, there!

01:30:12.116 --> 01:30:13.950
I will be back, understand?

01:30:26.909 --> 01:30:29.325
It looks like it turned out all right.

01:30:35.659 --> 01:30:39.117
Sorry to get you mixed up in all that.

01:30:39.243 --> 01:30:43.076
Don't worry about it. That was the most
thrilling and enjoyable time I've had

01:30:43.201 --> 01:30:46.034
since I joined the Frieza force.

01:30:47.326 --> 01:30:49.284
Think they'll come after us?

01:30:49.409 --> 01:30:51.575
Who knows?

01:30:52.576 --> 01:30:54.867
So, Cheelai,
where are you planning on going?

01:30:55.618 --> 01:30:57.201
To Broly's world.

01:30:57.326 --> 01:30:58.493
Vampa, huh?

01:30:59.493 --> 01:31:01.451
What world
should I let you off on, Lemo?

01:31:01.576 --> 01:31:07.618
Nah, I'll tag along with you.
The risk is the same no matter where I go.

01:31:07.743 --> 01:31:12.368
Being near the mighty Broly
will put me at ease.

01:31:16.409 --> 01:31:19.952
In that case, we'll have to stop along
the way to buy some food and stuff.

01:31:20.077 --> 01:31:21.202
THREE DAYS LATER

01:31:21.326 --> 01:31:24.868
Sure enough, it appears
that those two are together with Broly.

01:31:25.701 --> 01:31:28.285
Let us leave them alone for a while.

01:31:28.409 --> 01:31:32.160
We will allow them to bring
Broly's mind under control,

01:31:32.285 --> 01:31:35.244
and once he can release
that immense power

01:31:35.369 --> 01:31:37.369
without losing his sense of self,

01:31:37.494 --> 01:31:40.619
that is when he will become
the mightiest combatant.

01:31:41.494 --> 01:31:43.077
Do you think that will work?

01:31:44.743 --> 01:31:48.577
I certainly hope that it does.

01:31:48.702 --> 01:31:53.202
No matter how hard I try
to raise my battle power,

01:31:53.327 --> 01:31:57.911
my foes are still
both Son Goku and Vegeta.

01:31:58.035 --> 01:32:03.202
I would like to have one other, as well.

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:08.369
PLANETOID VAMPA

01:32:22.119 --> 01:32:25.702
You're kidding, right?
This is what you've been eating?

01:32:27.537 --> 01:32:31.537
Well, it's bitter, but it's better
than starving to death... I guess.

01:32:35.745 --> 01:32:37.578
Count me out.

01:32:37.703 --> 01:32:39.370
Don't ask for too much.

01:32:39.495 --> 01:32:42.662
We won't last even 50 days
on just the food we bought.

01:32:45.495 --> 01:32:47.787
Somebody's here.
Huh?

01:32:47.912 --> 01:32:50.286
Hey, can I come in?

01:32:54.162 --> 01:32:56.787
Huh? Who are you guys?

01:32:56.912 --> 01:32:59.453
You! You're the Saiyan from Earth!

01:32:59.578 --> 01:33:03.829
Oh, right! You're the ones from the Frieza
force who used the Dragon Balls!

01:33:05.037 --> 01:33:08.162
What are you doing here?

01:33:09.412 --> 01:33:11.412
You guys are Broly's friends?

01:33:11.538 --> 01:33:13.703
I asked you what you were doing here!

01:33:13.829 --> 01:33:15.579
Now, don't lose your temper.

01:33:15.704 --> 01:33:18.579
I ain't here to fight, okay?

01:33:18.704 --> 01:33:19.788
Then, why are you here?

01:33:19.912 --> 01:33:24.871
I heard your world was awful,
so I brought you some stuff.

01:33:24.995 --> 01:33:29.037
Who asked you to? Go away.
You can't trick us.

01:33:32.996 --> 01:33:37.788
I asked someone named Bulma,
and got this for you.

01:33:37.913 --> 01:33:40.830
Could you stand back?

01:33:45.412 --> 01:33:49.830
There's food and water and a bunch
of other stuff inside the house.

01:33:53.871 --> 01:33:56.413
Also, these are called Senzu beans.

01:33:56.539 --> 01:33:57.704
I'm giving you two of them.

01:33:57.830 --> 01:34:00.580
Eat one whenever you think,
"Yikes, I'm gonna die!"

01:34:00.705 --> 01:34:03.705
They don't work against illnesses,
but they completely heal injuries,

01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:06.038
and restore your strength to full, too.

01:34:07.205 --> 01:34:08.622
What are you plotting?

01:34:09.121 --> 01:34:12.997
It ain't like that.
I just want you to live healthy.

01:34:13.121 --> 01:34:14.121
Huh?
Huh?

01:34:14.247 --> 01:34:17.455
I was so sure of my own strength,

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:21.622
but then the much stronger Broly
showed up.

01:34:21.747 --> 01:34:23.330
And what's more, he's a Saiyan,
too, just like me.

01:34:23.872 --> 01:34:26.122
He's probably even stronger
than Beerus-sama.

01:34:26.622 --> 01:34:29.413
Beerus-sama is this god, you see.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:30.580
Goodness.

01:34:30.705 --> 01:34:34.456
Anyways, it would be a shame
to let someone so incredible...

01:34:35.289 --> 01:34:37.872
...up and die, right?

01:34:42.831 --> 01:34:46.623
Well, whatever.
Just take care of yourselves.

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:47.748
Bye.

01:34:47.872 --> 01:34:50.081
Huh? There's no ship.

01:34:50.206 --> 01:34:52.289
How did you get here?

01:34:53.039 --> 01:34:56.706
I can do Instantaneous Movement.
I just searched for Broly's Ki.

01:34:56.832 --> 01:35:00.498
I really don't get anything
you're telling us.

01:35:00.623 --> 01:35:02.164
Is it okay if I come again?

01:35:02.289 --> 01:35:05.915
Just so you know,
you're our enemy, understand?

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:08.623
We may be out of the Frieza force,

01:35:08.748 --> 01:35:10.832
but we're not becoming friends
with you.

01:35:12.082 --> 01:35:13.915
Doesn't matter to me either way.

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:15.332
Huh?

01:35:15.456 --> 01:35:19.623
I just want you to let me
come fight Broly once in a while.

01:35:19.748 --> 01:35:20.873
Huh?
Huh?

01:35:20.998 --> 01:35:25.290
There's some stuff
I'd like to teach him, too.

01:35:25.415 --> 01:35:28.290
You sure do seem to be pretty crazy.

01:35:28.832 --> 01:35:29.832
How come?

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:34.707
Well, anyway, I should offer my gratitude.
Thank you.

01:35:34.832 --> 01:35:37.707
Yeah. Bye now.
I'll be back again.

01:35:37.833 --> 01:35:40.582
We may not be here when you do.

01:35:40.707 --> 01:35:45.874
That's okay. As long as you ain't
too far away, I can find you.

01:35:47.916 --> 01:35:49.958
What's your name?

01:35:53.582 --> 01:35:57.958
Son Goku. Also...

01:35:58.083 --> 01:36:00.124
...Kakarot.
