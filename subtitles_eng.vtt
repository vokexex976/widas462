00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:55.722
(King Cold) Hmph

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.401
(Mutterings from the Saiyans)

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.197
(Gine) Ah...

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.371
(Saiyans) Ah, oh!

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.833
(Beats) Damn, that's crazy.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.424
(King Vegeta) Hmm...

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.845
(Butler) King Cold
is here.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.015
(King Vegeta) It seems so.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.642
(Butler) Hmm?

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:41.851
(Paragus) Ah...

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:12.715
(Frieza) Huff

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.013
(King Cold)
It's been a while, King Vegeta.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:22.809
Welcome, King Cold

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:28.064
(King Cold) Let me introduce you to
my son, Frieza.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:30.984
Ugh...

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:35.613
Ah... this... it's
nice to meet you, Lord Frieza.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.200
(Frieza)
Nice to meet you too.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.036
Ugh... ugh...

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.580
(King Cold) This is sudden, but...

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.125
I decided to retire

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.795
From now on, Frieza will take over the army.

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:55.425
In other words, Cold's army
will become Frieza's army.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:58.178
Ah... Um...

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.846
Nothing will change

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:04.475
Saiyans
should just follow orders from Frieza's army.

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.769
If it's just a little different

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:11.649
I guess Frieza is even more ruthless than me .

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:16.696
Hohohoho, nice to meet you

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.740
To all Saiyans:

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.744
I'm especially looking forward to it.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.496
Haa... aaah...

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.999
In commemoration of my appointment

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:30.960
I've brought you some new battle items .

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.130
A newly developed scouter

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.800
The scout scope I've been using until now

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:41.095
It is designed to be compact and easy to install

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.139
You can also make calls at the same time

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:45.683
As with previous scopes,

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:46.684
Same as previous scopes
(Scouter measurement sound)

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:46.768
(Scouter measuring sound)

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.020
(Scouter measurement sound)
Opponent's position and fighting power

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:50.897
And the distance is displayed...

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:51.189
Then the distance is displayed...
(measurement sound)

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.814
(measurement sound)

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:52.273
(measuring sound)
Oh?

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:52.899
Oh?

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.904
It seems that some Saiyans
are aiming their weapons at us...

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.030
cormorant…

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:02.200
The Saiyan fighting power hidden there ...

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:03.952
(Scouter measuring sound)

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:04.994
2000…

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.413
That's pretty good, isn't it?

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.131
It looks like this

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.926
Isn't that convenient?

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.720
(King Vegeta) Ugh...

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:26.849
Let's give away about 500 for now .

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.062
Please tell me if it's not enough

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:32.522
So

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:39.362
(King Vegeta) Ggggg...

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.449
(King Vegeta) I see.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.661
Has it grown so big already?

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:49.580
My proud son!

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:53.084
Your potential is genius

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.503
To be the king of the universe

00:04:55.586 --> 00:05:00.591
It's not some monster like Frieza, it's you

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:06.931
I'm looking forward to seeing it grow

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.857
Hmm? Who is this?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.901
Why is it in a special capsule?

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.695
(Moroko) Ha ha ha... Yes!

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.449
This
is Broly, Colonel Paragus' son.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.408
This
is Broly, Colonel Paragus' child
(unmeasurable sound)

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.492
(King Vegeta) Why?

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:30.121
This nursery
should be for the Saiyan elite.

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:33.124
Something for a great baby

00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:35.084
(Moroko) Yes, that's right...

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.088
Broly's potential is special.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.549
(King Vegeta)
My son's genius numbers

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:43.134
You mean they're comparable?

00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:45.053
- (Moroko) Yes, yes
- (Shito) Um

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.888
It depends on when you measure it

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.724
It's a level that exceeds the prince's numbers ...

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.811
That's impossible

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.481
Even Prince's numbers are the highest they've ever been.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:57.940
Lend it to me!

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:02.403
(Broly cries)

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.614
(Sound of something breaking)

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.532
- (King Vegeta) Whoa-
(Shito and the others) Ah...

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.745
Sorry,
it seems to have been a malfunction

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:12.246
New instruments soon!

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.873
(Nion) I'll bring it right away.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.958
(measurement sound)

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.712
(Moroko) After retesting,
the numbers were reduced by half.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.382
There have been some abnormal numbers in the past .

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.468
It's probably a malfunction of the instrument.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.930
(Nion) But even if we eliminate such abnormal data,

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:31.516
Broly's potential
is immense.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.725
(King Vegeta) Hmm...

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.063
If he continues training like this,
he will grow into a great warrior.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.440
To the powerful fighting force of our army

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:43.152
(Nion) That's
even the legendary Super Saiyan...

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.112
Hmm...

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.156
Damn...

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.700
- (Guard) Lord Paragus
- (Paragus) Let go!

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.622
Please forgive my rudeness

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:58.084
My... my son, Broly.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.879
Apparently they're planning to send it off to a remote planet in a pod.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.215
(King Vegeta) That's right.

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:07.510
(Paragus)
That's... the role of a lower-ranking warrior.

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:11.389
(King Vegeta)
If we can grow to the point where we can conquer the planet.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:14.767
Maybe he'll become an even stronger warrior.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.104
Control the stars and sell at a high price

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:21.607
That's us, the Saiyan warrior race.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:25.027
(Paragus) Our destination,
the asteroid Bumpa,

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.157
It's a harsh planet with no humans

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.326
I don't think it will sell for much though...

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.997
(King Vegeta)
Your son's potential is...

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.583
Abnormally too expensive

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:41.794
You could call it a mutation

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.798
Eventually, you will no longer be able to maintain a normal mental state .

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.885
Let alone our Vegeta Army.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.513
It would put the universe itself at risk.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.684
Even if I just send you flying to the stars without taking your life

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.186
Be grateful

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.605
(Paragus) Uh... That's...

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.358
Ugh... Ah... You

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:08.404
Jealous of Broly, who has greater potential than the prince

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.615
Let's kill him!

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:13.451
Open your mouth any more

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:15.870
You're going to die

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:18.039
Ugh... ahh...

00:08:18.122 --> 00:08:20.041
And it's too late

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.044
The pod has now launched

00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:24.128
Hey!

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.804
- (Paragus) Get out of the way!
- (Staff) What are you doing?

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.265
(Beets) Ah

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.352
Please wait,
no permission to depart!

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.312
Ugh Ah

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:42.396
(Staff) It's dangerous!

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.900
(Air Traffic Controller)
Return immediately. I repeat...

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:47.860
(Beats) Please come back soon.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:50.738
(Paragus) That's not right.
I have to save my son!

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.406
(Beets) Wow.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.908
(Paragus) King Vegeta

00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:58.329
He was proud of the genius abilities of the prince born at the same time.

00:08:58.412 --> 00:09:02.792
The existence of my son, Broly, who has surpassed that ability

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.752
I didn't like it.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:08.881
Apparently the pod's destination
was a remote planet.

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:14.428
It's an asteroid called Bumpa orbiting star 94.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.930
(Beets) Why...

00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:19.433
There shouldn't be any planets with humans around there.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:23.312
(Paragus) The king's goal
is not to obtain the stars.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.816
Eliminate my son, Broly.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.403
(Beats) Uh... Uh...

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:32.488
(Paragas) Don't worry, Beets.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:37.159
Once we rescue Broly,
we'll live on another planet.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:41.038
You take us down to the planet and
return to Planet Vegeta.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.499
(Beats)
Aren't you going home?

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:47.253
Of course, if
I go back I'll just be executed.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:51.465
I will raise Broly to be the strongest warrior.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:55.595
One day I will get revenge on King Vegeta!

00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:02.476
♪～

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.005
～♪

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.675
(Beats)
Is that the asteroid Bumpa?

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:39.263
According to calculations, the pod
should have arrived about two days earlier.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.267
Stay alive Broly,
I'll help you right away

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.937
It should be around there.

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:49.231
(Beetroot Paragus) Ugh

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.318
Where the light hits it,
it looks calm.

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:53.903
Let's land there

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.863
(Paragus) No, I'll go ahead with it!

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.490
（衝突音）

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.954
(Paragus) I'll go look for him right away.
Follow me.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.749
- (Beets) Oh... me too?
- (Paragas) Yes.

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:09.668
It would be a problem if they flew away while we were searching for them.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:13.130
(Beats) I won't do that,
trust me.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:16.926
(Paragus) Hmph , are there any Saiyans you can trust ?

00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:22.139
(Beats)
It seems that scout scope is a new model.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.934
Apparently it was brought by a new commander called Frieza.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.061
(Paragas) I know.

00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:29.563
(Beats) He seems
like an incredibly amazing guy.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:30.815
Frieza

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:33.067
(Paragus) It doesn't concern me anymore.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:35.611
(earthquake)

00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:36.696
(Earth rumbling)
(2 people) Huh?

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.781
(Beets) What... what is it?

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.576
(Paragus) Ah...

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:44.870
(Beets) Hi!

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.961
(Paragus) Wow.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.426
(Beets) Hii...
What... What is it?

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:02.763
No joke
, I'm not even a fighter

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.855
Night and storms seem to go hand in hand.

00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:12.398
It's hot now

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:16.944
Is that star a satellite?
It's a full moon.

00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:18.738
(Paragus)
Don't look at it for too long.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.072
I'll become a great ape

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.491
(Beets) Huh? Ah, yes.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.077
I've never become a great ape .

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.913
(Paragus)
The Great Ape loses his mind.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:32.084
It only happens when you're cornered and
there's nothing you can do

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:35.296
Wh... what?

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.591
(Beets) The ground is soft

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:40.426
This doesn't even seem to be grass.

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:46.265
Ah, those guys...

00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:49.602
It's like drinking something from the ground .

00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:53.105
(Both) Wow, wow, ahhh

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.273
(Paragus) What?

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.909
(Roar of the Beast)

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:10.206
That's not a grassland, that's a giant beast

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:13.542
Monsters
live by sucking the blood of animals.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.462
The beast lives by eating the monster.

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.965
(Beats)
It's a... creepy planet.

00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:25.012
Ah! A pod!
There's a pod over there.

00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:32.937
(Paragus) He's not here
. Where did he go?

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.064
Did it get eaten?

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:36.398
Ah!

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:38.943
Over there

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.075
(Beets) Guhhhh~

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.161
Are you sure it's here?

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:53.332
(Response sound)

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:02.550
(Paragus) Oh...

00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:12.518
Broly!

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:17.731
He attacked the monster and ate its legs.
What a sight!

00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:20.150
(Beats)
That's Broly

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:24.780
Combat power 920?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.740
Aren't you stronger than me ?

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.952
(Paragus)
No matter how powerful a genius he is in combat,

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:33.247
920 won't be able to defeat that monster

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.833
(Broly) Ugh, ugh!

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:39.837
Look, the suit's a little stretched out and
baggy

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:44.258
Seeing that full moon,
he must have turned into a great ape

00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:47.052
Let's hurry and leave this planet

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.388
(Paragus) It's pretty broken.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:52.683
(Beats) Ah, so...

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.101
what up?

00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:56.812
(Beets)
The main floater is cracked.

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:59.398
(Paragus) Surely...
you can't fix it?

00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:03.027
(Beats) Absolutely not.
Without a new floater...

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.113
(Paragus) What?
You mean I can't move from here?

00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:09.283
(Beats) In a place like this,
you can't even call for help over the radio.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:12.745
(Paragas) We have enough food and water for 10 days.

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:15.831
(Beats) Do you think you can find it in just 10 days ?

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:20.878
Ah, I guess
we shouldn't have made the forced landing after all.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.673
(Paragas)
This will save us food for one person.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.467
(Beets) Huh? Ah...

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.384
Wow

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:30.888
(sound of something falling)

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.019
(Leak) Bardock-san
Bardock-san

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.103
(Bardock) Hmm...

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:39.855
(Bardock) What?

00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:42.316
(Leak)
It's almost time for Planet Vegeta

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.443
It's been a while

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:45.653
(Bardock) Ah

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.155
(Leak) What do you mean?

00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:51.909
Saiyans hurry up and
gather on Planet Vegeta

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:54.286
(Leak)
Apparently it was an order from that bastard Frieza.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.455
Get your scouter, they'll ask you

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:57.956
Ah, I see.

00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:06.131
Look,
everyone is coming back one after another.

00:16:07.174 --> 00:16:09.259
- (Bardock) Look over there
- (Leak) Ah...

00:16:09.843 --> 00:16:11.512
(Bardock) It's Frieza's ship.

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:15.516
(Leak) There's still time,
but are you already waiting?

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:20.062
(Bardock)
Don't you think that's weird?

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:25.109
If you have something to say,
you don't have to go to the trouble of sending it back to the stars, you can just communicate over the radio

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:29.655
If you want to give us new weapons,
there's no point in rushing to collect them.

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:35.661
There seems to be something behind this guy after all

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:38.539
(Leak) Huh?
What's that?

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:41.959
(Bardock) Originally,
conquering the planet and selling it

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:45.254
We are a warrior race,
the livelihood of the Saiyans

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:49.758
Frieza's father, Cold,

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:54.054
He used force to subjugate me and
make me his subordinate.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.724
(Leak) That was a long time ago, wasn't it?

00:16:57.641 --> 00:17:00.227
(Bardock)
Do you think things are going well now?

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.022
(Leak) Well, there's no Saiyan who likes Frieza.

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:06.984
(sound of landing)

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:10.112
Frieza must think the same of Saiyans .

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:11.029
(Leak) Huh?

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:14.074
(Bardock)
Now, Frieza's army has grown.

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:18.203
Things will be fine without those annoying Saiyans

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:19.121
(Door opening sound)

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.542
(Leak) No way...

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:26.879
Are you saying you're going to exterminate us ?

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:30.716
Maybe...

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:31.633
Huh?

00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:35.012
I... I don't like it, Bardock.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:41.018
(Taro) Hey Bardock,
you came back alive?

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.397
Hey, do you know the reason for this summons ?

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:50.235
Well, you must have found a really big star .

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:53.530
It seems like it can't be conquered without all of us

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:56.075
I see! That's it!

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:59.703
Speaking of which, the people directly under Frieza

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:02.706
I've been hearing about Super Saiyans.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:08.003
Super Saiyan? The legendary one?

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:10.464
That's it!

00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:17.137
(Kikono) Super Saiyan
Super Saiyan God

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:21.016
I looked into it and
it seems to be just a legend

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:24.186
(Frieza)
I thought that would be the case.

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:28.565
There should be no anxiety whatsoever for me,

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.567
Just to be safe

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:33.028
(Kikono) So the attack is cancelled?

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.906
Ohohoho, you're kidding

00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:37.032
fart?

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.952
We've taken the trouble to gather everyone together.

00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:47.000
Isn't this the perfect opportunity to have the whole star disappear ?

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.712
(Saiyan) Welcome back,
Bardock

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.672
(Bardock) Yeah

00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:56.468
Hey, I'm back, Gine.

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.220
Huh? Bardock!

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.973
The town is quite lively

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:03.976
Ah, everyone's back

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:05.477
(Bardock) What about Raditz?

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:09.606
He's already a fighter,
teaming up with Prince Vegeta and heading to the planet

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.817
He hasn't come back yet though.

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:14.153
Prince Vegeta?

00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:17.656
I was paired with a troublesome guy.

00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:22.202
What about Kakarot?
Is he still in the daycare capsule?

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:26.248
Ah, it's coming out soon, do you
want to see it?

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:32.379
(Bardock) It's small.

00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:34.923
(Gine) It seems to be a slow growing type.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.758
But it looks just like you, doesn't it?

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:39.553
Especially the unique hairstyle

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:41.555
Hehehe

00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:47.102
(Bardock) When night falls,
he'll steal the pod.

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.020
(Gine) Huh...

00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:50.230
(Bardock)
Let's send this guy to the stars.

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:52.399
(Gine) Huh, are you kidding?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.443
No, I'm serious.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.988
Why would you bother doing that now ?

00:19:58.071 --> 00:19:59.948
I haven't even taught you the words yet

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:04.995
With Kakarot's potential,
he's destined to be blown away anyway.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:09.541
If so, I'll send you to a slightly
better planet.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.127
But it's still too early

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.505
There may not be time

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:16.882
What time?

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.800
Frieza is

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:22.596
Fearing the emergence of the legendary Super Saiyan

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.515
Super Saiyan...

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:30.020
That's just a fabrication

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:34.524
Ah, but I
can't help but worry about him.

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:37.402
And he's plotting something evil

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:38.654
a…

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:43.158
I have a premonition of death

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:51.500
(Gine) I guess I should stop
doing this.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.251
Don't worry

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:56.505
If it's my mistake,
I'll come and help you right away.

00:20:57.172 --> 00:20:58.715
(Pod tapping)

00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:02.552
If that's the case, then
let's all three run away somewhere

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:07.015
No good, we
'll be spotted right away by the scouters

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.058
(Gine) But...

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:10.811
Why go to such lengths?

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:15.607
It's not like a Saiyan for a man to worry about his children.

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.237
(Bardock)
Always in the middle of a battle

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.573
Maybe I just wanted to save something on a whim

00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:28.120
He was judged to be a particularly low-ranking warrior.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.247
My child

00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:33.792
(Kakarot crying)

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:38.380
(Bardock)
I programmed a distant planet called Earth.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.135
It's a planet inhabited by people with low technological and combat skills.

00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:45.929
I think you can survive too

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.307
Because it's not worth much

00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:52.310
There is also a low possibility that they will be targeted by the Frieza Army.

00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:57.024
If Bardock is overthinking it,
I'll come and get him right away.

00:21:57.107 --> 00:22:00.068
Listen, you'll definitely survive.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.114
See you again

00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:09.036
(Bardock) See you then.

00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:19.421
(Gine) Kakarot!

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:26.636
Ahh... ugh

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.223
(sobbing)

00:22:39.107 --> 00:22:43.403
(Kikono) If the Saiyans were gone,
our military strength would be halved.

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.781
(Frieza) That much
can be done.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:49.785
They
have no choice but to pretend to be obedient

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.037
There's no telling when they'll bare their fangs

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.205
picture?

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:57.751
After all, they are a fighting people.

00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:02.881
I need to clean it up before the dust starts flying

00:23:19.147 --> 00:23:20.774
Hohohoho...

00:23:20.857 --> 00:23:22.943
Kiyaaaa!

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:28.323
Ah...

00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:31.827
ah…

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:39.918
Woooowwwww!

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:45.549
Grrrrrr!

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:51.638
(Screams)

00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:09.030
(Explosion)

00:24:11.908 --> 00:24:14.244
This has made me feel refreshed.

00:24:14.327 --> 00:24:16.371
(Scouter measuring sound)

00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:24.212
(Sound of numbers stopping)

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:25.422
(Saiyan) What?

00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:27.257
(Nappa) What's wrong?

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.884
A message from the Frieza Army...

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:32.012
A meteorite crashes into Planet Vegeta...

00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:33.096
(Nappa) Huh?

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.266
It... it's disappeared!

00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:38.685
- (Saiyan) Huh?
- (Nappa) Huh? What?

00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:41.730
Most of the Saiyans are
wiped out...

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:44.774
Why didn't we know the meteorite was coming ?

00:24:46.693 --> 00:24:49.154
(Raditz) That was lucky.

00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:52.282
We
ignored Frieza's order to assemble.

00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:55.285
(Vegeta) Tch!
Vegeta failed to become King.

00:24:55.368 --> 00:24:56.203
Huh...

00:24:56.286 --> 00:24:58.246
(Nappa) Vegeta, you had a younger brother, right?

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.666
Come to think of it,
I wonder what happened to him

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.752
Well, I'm not interested

00:25:05.378 --> 00:25:07.380
Raditz also has a younger brother...

00:25:07.464 --> 00:25:08.465
Hmph!

00:25:08.548 --> 00:25:11.301
He
was judged to be a low-ranking warrior.

00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:14.304
It's in a home childcare capsule.

00:25:14.387 --> 00:25:15.513
Embarrassing

00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:21.686
Ah , did your mother call to say you were blown away by pod ?

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:24.731
I don't care though

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:30.862
Hmph

00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:38.078
(Broly) Huh?

00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:00.475
(Vegeta) Hmph

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:02.352
(Goku) Aaaah!

00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:06.189
Here we go!
Here we go!

00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:07.857
(Vegeta)
Aaah!

00:26:11.194 --> 00:26:13.822
(Combat sounds)

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:15.240
(Bloomers) Ufufu

00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:19.077
Hmm...

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:24.457
(Whis) Mmm, delicious!

00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:30.088
Ahh, the food and the air!
It's truly a wonderful villa.

00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:31.673
Hey, Bulma-san

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.592
Hehe, isn't that good?

00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:35.927
(Combat sounds)

00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:38.138
- (Vegeta) Yesssss!
- (Goku) Wow!

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:45.312
Huh

00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:46.354
Hehe

00:26:47.063 --> 00:26:48.732
(Vegeta) Here we go!

00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:50.608
(Goku) Ah ha!

00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:53.445
(Bulma)
I've been making it for years.

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:56.906
1600 km south of the western capital

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.119
On this deserted island,
it's okay to go wild a little

00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:02.370
Hehehe

00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:06.875
Those guys
might destroy the Western Capital sooner or later.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:07.876
Haaaah!

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:09.377
Guh

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.503
Yeahhh!

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:16.760
(Beerus) Aaaahhh!

00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.928
Shut up!

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:23.141
Fight a little quieter!

00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:31.191
(Whis) Hmph...
By the way, Goku-san

00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:32.192
(Goku) Huh?

00:27:32.275 --> 00:27:35.820
(Whis) Why do you seek greater strength than this ?

00:27:35.904 --> 00:27:39.199
Perhaps he is aiming for the position of God of Destruction ?

00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:40.492
(Goku) Huh?

00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:43.495
What?
That's unacceptable.

00:27:43.578 --> 00:27:47.123
No,
I don't want to be like that.

00:27:47.207 --> 00:27:50.335
Ugh, I'm sorry about that.

00:27:50.418 --> 00:27:53.838
(Goku) In the last All-Universe Tournament
,

00:27:53.922 --> 00:27:56.841
I realized there are still some crazy people out there.

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:01.388
I'm on fire!

00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:06.184
Does that mean your eyes are already set on other universes ?

00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:08.770
He's still the same naive guy

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:13.483
So why does Vegeta
want to become even stronger?

00:28:13.566 --> 00:28:14.692
It's Frieza!

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:17.946
Of all people, this idiot here

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:21.324
Because he resurrected that demon .

00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:22.325
What is it?

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:23.576
If Frieza wasn't there

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.580
Our Universe 7
might have disappeared.

00:28:27.664 --> 00:28:29.207
Oh, is that so?

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.168
Ah, he saved me

00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:33.169
You idiot!

00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:35.839
I was just thinking about myself

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:42.429
Did you see Frieza come to Earth the other day?

00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:45.223
He's
accomplished so much in such a short amount of time.

00:28:46.015 --> 00:28:47.392
(Frieza) Hmmmm...

00:28:47.475 --> 00:28:51.479
Are you going to get even stronger and come to defeat us again ?

00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:53.356
Without a doubt

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.358
I wonder~

00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:57.360
Did I bring him back to life?

00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:02.240
You idiot! Do you
really think he'd be grateful for something like that?

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.410
How many times have I called you an idiot?

00:29:05.493 --> 00:29:07.078
Heh heh heh

00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:08.955
I'll say it again and again!

00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:10.999
Buwaaaaa!

00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:12.709
(Ringtone)

00:29:12.792 --> 00:29:15.211
Huh? It's Trunks.

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:17.964
(Trunks) Ah

00:29:18.047 --> 00:29:19.716
- (Bulma) What?
- (Goku/Vegeta) Huh?

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:24.345
It seems like a burglar has broken into the lab.

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.598
Huh? What did they take?

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:28.767
Let's take a look at the surveillance cameras

00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:30.143
Um...

00:29:32.353 --> 00:29:34.981
The Dragon Balls that my mom collected

00:29:35.064 --> 00:29:36.733
It's a dragon radar

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:38.818
What did you say?

00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:40.612
(Goten Trunks) Wow!

00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:44.491
That's why I told you
, your security is lax

00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:46.159
(Trunks) Hey, Mom.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.037
It's the culprit who was on screen.

00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:52.707
You're dressed like your dad

00:29:54.918 --> 00:29:56.169
(Vegeta and Bulma) Ah

00:29:56.252 --> 00:29:58.087
- (Bulma) Hmm...
- (Vegeta) Uh-huh.

00:29:58.171 --> 00:29:59.672
- (Bulma) Hmm-
(Goku) Huh?

00:29:59.756 --> 00:30:01.007
(Sigh)

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.592
Thank you Trunks

00:30:02.675 --> 00:30:03.510
(Trunks) Hehe

00:30:04.093 --> 00:30:06.137
(Vegeta) The culprit is Frieza's army.

00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:07.555
So that we don't notice

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:10.642
I purposely used people with low fighting ability.

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:15.146
Frieza was persistently
after the Dragon Balls

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.692
What kind of wish does he have now ?

00:30:19.776 --> 00:30:22.946
You can't make a wish that exceeds the power of Shenron the Dragon.

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:26.407
It's impossible to make me the strongest in the universe .

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:30.119
Of course,
his wish is to never die

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:34.499
But even if you don't die,
it's meaningless if you lose

00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:39.504
Even so,
there's a chance that he might surpass us someday.

00:30:39.587 --> 00:30:40.964
I see?

00:30:41.047 --> 00:30:42.632
Mumble mumble...

00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:45.510
I had
six Dragon Balls.

00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:49.597
I'll go there to get the last one.

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:50.598
Where is it?

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:52.684
The ice continent

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:55.770
I don't like the cold so I put it off.

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.355
Ice continent?

00:30:57.438 --> 00:31:00.191
Hmm, are you guys going too?

00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:03.027
Hmm, I'm going to take a nap.

00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:06.406
Oh, doesn't that sound interesting?

00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:08.449
Is there anything good?

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.868
That's not to be expected

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:12.579
Well then, I'll stop.

00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:14.956
That's good!

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.500
Well, take care of my bra.

00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:20.086
Thank you very much~

00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:23.214
Hey, hey!

00:31:27.343 --> 00:31:29.721
The ice continent is cold!

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.100
I need to buy some winter clothes on the way.

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:37.520
Why did Bulma
collect the Dragon Balls?

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.857
You're so noisy

00:31:41.357 --> 00:31:42.692
Tell me

00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:43.735
(Bloomers) Hmm...

00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:49.282
I was trying to look younger, like five years old.

00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:52.911
Dragon Ball for such a stupid reason ?

00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.287
Shut up!

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.123
You Saiyans
don't understand

00:31:57.206 --> 00:31:58.041
Hmph

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:02.670
Why 5 years old?
Maybe more...

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:05.590
It would be unnatural to suddenly become younger.

00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:07.133
I'm sure you'll say

00:32:08.217 --> 00:32:13.681
"Oh, Bulma, you
've suddenly gotten younger, haven't you?"

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:18.102
"Maybe she had plastic surgery?"

00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:20.021
Or something like that

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:23.775
I see,
you use Dragon Balls a lot.

00:32:23.858 --> 00:32:25.276
Hahaha

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:32.325
Wow, oh oh!

00:32:32.408 --> 00:32:35.453
(laughter)

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:42.126
(Frieza) Huff

00:32:50.551 --> 00:32:51.886
(Kikono) Lord Frieza

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.139
Vegeta's wife
with the Dragon Radar

00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:59.227
Apparently he already owns six Dragon Balls .

00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:01.646
Get it

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:05.316
It seems they are currently on their way to find the last one.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.027
That is a wonderful report.

00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:12.281
Shall we launch the ship towards Earth ?

00:33:12.907 --> 00:33:16.911
No, it'll be fine once we've found all seven.

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.206
It's dangerous to arrive in a hurry

00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:22.375
They don't need a scouter

00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:25.753
It seems like you can sense the approach of a powerful force.

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:26.838
Huh?

00:33:28.423 --> 00:33:29.507
Understood

00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:31.718
(Frieza)
How to make a wish come true

00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:33.511
Have you made a note of it?

00:33:33.594 --> 00:33:35.805
(Kikono) Yes,
without any mistakes

00:33:36.639 --> 00:33:37.807
by the way…

00:33:38.307 --> 00:33:39.892
What is it? Kikono

00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:43.563
(Kikono) No... no... that...

00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:46.274
If the Dragon Balls were collected

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:51.654
What kind of wish does Lord Frieza
intend to grant?

00:33:52.238 --> 00:33:55.742
Is this the immortal body you mentioned before
?

00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:58.745
Hohohoho, that's not right

00:33:58.828 --> 00:33:59.829
picture?

00:34:01.164 --> 00:34:06.002
I realized this after being stuck in hell on earth

00:34:06.085 --> 00:34:10.798
Even if you don't die, if you can't move,
it's just painful

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:14.385
(Kikono) So, for example...

00:34:15.094 --> 00:34:19.223
Take no damage... or something?

00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:23.269
That would
n't make the game any more fun

00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:24.437
(Kikono) Huh...

00:34:24.937 --> 00:34:28.983
Hmm, what is it?

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:32.070
Hohohoho, you won't get it

00:34:32.153 --> 00:34:36.491
(Very Blue)
Do you want to grow taller?

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:37.450
Ugh

00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:41.537
Huh! B... Berry-san
What are you doing!

00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:46.167
(Very Blue) The soldier who secretly
called Lord Frieza a shorty

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.045
Many people have been erased

00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:52.423
As expected from you, Mr. Verible

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:55.009
That's correct.

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.052
Huh?

00:34:56.135 --> 00:34:57.553
(Swallowing sound)

00:34:57.637 --> 00:34:59.388
Is that the correct answer?

00:34:59.472 --> 00:35:02.558
Can you promise not to tell anyone?

00:35:02.642 --> 00:35:05.228
Of course... yeah yeah yeah

00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:07.396
Height...

00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:10.233
5 centimeters

00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:12.610
I want to grow it

00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:14.112
Huh?

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.364
So... if that's the case

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:20.201
If it remains transformed into the second form

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:22.703
Tall enough...

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.205
no!

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:29.043
I
want to grow bigger in my normal and final form.

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:33.881
So why only 5 centimetres...

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.220
It's unnatural for it to grow so suddenly !

00:35:41.597 --> 00:35:45.059
I want it to feel like it's still growing.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:50.439
(Kikono) I see... I see...

00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:59.949
(Cheerai) There's no one here

00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:03.744
(Chirai) And even worse,
someone with a fighting power of at least 1000.

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.663
There aren't many

00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:07.123
(Remo) It can't be helped.

00:36:07.206 --> 00:36:12.378
I have orders to find as many combatants as possible to revive the military.

00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:14.797
(Chirai)
There were a lot of fighters, right?

00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.508
(Remo) Rumor
has it that he fought poorly.

00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:20.344
Apparently they were all killed by Frieza.

00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:22.597
Tch

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.516
(Remo) Cheelai,
why did you join Frieza's army?

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:30.313
They found out I stole a Galactic Patrol spaceship .

00:36:30.396 --> 00:36:33.149
If it's Frieza's army,
they won't lay a hand on him, right?

00:36:33.232 --> 00:36:35.151
Haa... that's rubbish.

00:36:35.234 --> 00:36:36.944
Well, yeah~

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:40.197
Remo-san, you
've always been in the Frieza army, right?

00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:42.533
Have you ever met
Lord Frieza ?

00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:44.285
(Remo) I'm not a fighter.

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.746
I've only seen it at the station .

00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:48.372
It seems small

00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:49.707
Ugh...

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.418
I'm never going to say that again

00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:54.795
If you want to live

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.130
I get it

00:36:56.213 --> 00:36:59.717
(Remo) Some people have been killed just because their breath smelled bad .

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.845
But
it seems like he's using an old man and a woman.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:05.556
The Frieza Army
might be in trouble soon.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.016
(Signal sound)

00:37:07.016 --> 00:37:07.808
(Signal)
Huh? What's that?

00:37:07.808 --> 00:37:08.726
Huh? What?

00:37:08.809 --> 00:37:10.937
(Remo) Huh? It's a distress signal.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.815
And it's a pretty old-fashioned
Frieza Army signal.

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:16.359
(Cheerai) That's the star you can see over there

00:37:16.442 --> 00:37:19.403
(Remo) If you help us,
you might get a special bonus.

00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:20.696
(Cheerful) Oh~

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.615
(Remo) Okay, let's get started.

00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:26.911
(Paragus) Ah... Ugh...

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:30.164
Ha ha...

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.499
No one there

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:32.875
See?

00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:34.543
Try using a scouter

00:37:35.127 --> 00:37:37.713
(Paragus) Oh... oh~

00:37:37.838 --> 00:37:38.839
(Remo Chirai) Ah

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.549
Frieza's army? Ah...

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.344
Ugh...

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.392
Is that a tail?

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:53.062
You... are you a Saiyan?

00:37:53.145 --> 00:37:54.021
(Chirai) Saiyan?

00:37:55.815 --> 00:37:58.234
Ah, I'm Paragus

00:37:58.901 --> 00:38:00.736
A Saiyan from Frieza's army

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.446
The distress signal is...

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.950
Oh it's me,
the spaceship broke down

00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:07.159
(Start-up sound)

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:08.411
I can't believe how long I've waited

00:38:08.411 --> 00:38:10.663
I can't believe how long I've been waiting
(Scouter measuring noise)

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.791
Finally saved

00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:14.625
Finally, I was saved
(measurement sound)

00:38:15.251 --> 00:38:18.546
(Chirai) Combat power 4200! Good job!

00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:20.089
(Remo) Are you alone?

00:38:20.172 --> 00:38:20.756
(Paragus) No, there's one more...

00:38:20.756 --> 00:38:21.757
(Paragus) No, there's one more...
(footsteps)

00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:28.222
(Chirai Remo) Wow wow!

00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:30.141
Broly!

00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:31.934
(Broly) Huh!

00:38:34.186 --> 00:38:35.021
So here it is!

00:38:36.188 --> 00:38:38.733
(Cheer) Ah...

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:40.568
(Scouter measuring sound)

00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:48.326
This is my son, Broly.

00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:50.453
(unmeasurable sound)

00:38:50.536 --> 00:38:52.705
Huh... No way!

00:38:52.788 --> 00:38:53.706
(Remo) What?

00:38:53.789 --> 00:38:57.877
I...
I can't measure your fighting power.

00:38:58.377 --> 00:39:01.380
Huh? That's stupid . That's impossible...

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:01.672
Huh? That's stupid. That's impossible...
(unmeasurable sound)

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:02.423
(unmeasurable sound)

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:04.050
Uwahahaha~

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.634
Get on board

00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:07.762
Lord Frieza
will be pleased

00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:16.520
Um...
what did you say?

00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:18.689
Broly

00:39:20.316 --> 00:39:23.778
Would you like to eat this? Broly
. It's delicious.

00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:25.988
Look

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.910
Whoa! Rip open the package.

00:39:33.412 --> 00:39:35.498
(sniffing noises)

00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:37.166
(Paragus) Thank you Broly.

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:40.961
a…

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.674
Haha, how's it going? Isn't it delicious?

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:49.637
What? No courtesy at all.

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:52.348
(Paragus)
Say thank you, Broly.

00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:55.810
thank you

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:59.355
That's stiff, just say "thank you"

00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:03.109
Th... Thank you?

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:04.985
Ou

00:40:07.988 --> 00:40:11.033
(Very Blue) I've brought you here,
Lord Frieza

00:40:11.117 --> 00:40:12.743
I see

00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:17.581
Are you really a Saiyan?

00:40:21.043 --> 00:40:22.962
It doesn't seem to have a tail?

00:40:23.671 --> 00:40:24.922
(Paragas) Yes.

00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:28.968
Due to the Saiyan's characteristic
ability to transform into a Great Ape

00:40:29.468 --> 00:40:34.056
There was a time when I lost my mind,
and I...

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:38.227
(Frieza) Have you ever lost your temper since then?

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.146
(Paragas) Yes, rarely...

00:40:40.729 --> 00:40:44.108
(Frieza) Does that happen sometimes?

00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:46.235
Please rest assured.

00:40:46.318 --> 00:40:49.697
In that case, use this remote control

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.325
An electric current flows through the device worn around Broly's neck.

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:57.288
It's not a strong current, but
it can be suppressed.

00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:58.873
(Frieza) I see.

00:41:01.083 --> 00:41:02.710
What's your name?

00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:08.632
It's Broly

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:14.597
He still has incredible fighting power
hidden within him.

00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:19.268
I am confident that I will be of great help to Lord Frieza.

00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:20.728
I am confident that I will be of some use to Lord Frieza.
(Frieza) Hohohoho...

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:23.939
This is an unexpected harvest

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:28.944
Belible, please offer a reward to the two who find them.

00:41:29.028 --> 00:41:30.404
(Remo and Cheelai are delighted)

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.532
- (Cheerai) Oh~
- (Remo) It's... so much!

00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:35.701
(Chillai Remo)
Thank you very much.

00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:40.122
(Frieza) For a long time,
from a planet that seems empty

00:41:40.206 --> 00:41:42.750
It seems they were unable to escape.

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:43.709
(Paragas) Yes.

00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:46.378
Planet Vegeta is the place to return to

00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:50.132
Did you know that it's no longer there
?

00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:54.345
Yes, I heard about it on the way here.

00:41:54.428 --> 00:41:57.223
But that
doesn't matter.

00:41:57.932 --> 00:41:58.891
just…

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:01.602
Revenge...right?

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:02.978
(Paragus) Ah...

00:42:04.271 --> 00:42:05.898
(Frieza) Paragus

00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:08.525
Vegeta IV, son of King Vegeta

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:12.029
Did you know you're still alive
?

00:42:12.112 --> 00:42:16.617
Wh... What?!
Prince Vegeta...

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:20.454
Damn you, Vegeta!

00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:25.334
(Frieza) I will lend you my strength in your revenge .

00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:30.256
Verible-san, if you two
take a shower,

00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:33.342
Please prepare your battle uniform.

00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:35.719
yes

00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:38.430
Huh

00:42:39.014 --> 00:42:43.352
I wasn't planning on fighting this time .

00:42:44.603 --> 00:42:48.148
This is getting interesting

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:54.822
(Cheerai) Hahaha

00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:55.739
(Cheer) Hahaha
(sound of door opening)

00:42:55.823 --> 00:42:57.157
Hello

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.201
Isn't that refreshing?

00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:00.744
Eat here

00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:03.539
Broly, where's your battle suit?

00:43:04.039 --> 00:43:07.376
That is hard to move

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:09.461
Once you put it on, it's not like that.

00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:12.047
Well, do as you like.

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:15.968
But throw away the fur around your waist

00:43:16.051 --> 00:43:18.220
It's dirty and smelly

00:43:18.304 --> 00:43:20.055
Ha, no good!

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:21.390
Wow

00:43:21.473 --> 00:43:23.309
(Murmuring from the crew)

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:27.313
I...
I see It was something important.

00:43:30.816 --> 00:43:32.985
This is mine...

00:43:33.068 --> 00:43:35.696
Broly, I came for dinner.

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.614
I didn't come here to talk.

00:43:40.659 --> 00:43:43.162
Come on,
isn't this enough?

00:43:43.245 --> 00:43:45.581
Don't speak too much.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.541
ah?

00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:48.459
Not bad

00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:51.503
(Daigen) Hey, are you new?

00:43:53.672 --> 00:43:57.051
It's no fun being with these nerdy people

00:43:57.551 --> 00:44:01.597
The only decent combatants on this ship for this operation are

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.599
It's just me

00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:05.851
Come on, come on.

00:44:05.934 --> 00:44:08.896
Let go, I said I don't want to

00:44:09.938 --> 00:44:12.650
I'll buy you a drink today

00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:13.984
- (Daigen) Shut up, old man
- (Remo)

00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:15.152
(Cheerai) Ah

00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:17.237
Hmmmm

00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:18.697
Stop it Broly

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:21.784
(Daigen)
What's wrong? Are you complaining?

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.329
be

00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:27.456
That's it!

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:31.043
Wh shit shit!

00:44:31.126 --> 00:44:32.419
Ugh

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:33.545
(Paragus) Broly!

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:40.302
Guuuuaaaahh!

00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:41.428
Huh...

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:43.764
(button press sound)

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.099
(Start-up sound)

00:44:45.099 --> 00:44:45.432
(Start-up sound)
(Electric shock sound)

00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:45.516
(electric shock sound)

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.309
(Sound of electricity)
(Broly) Guh Aaahhh!

00:44:47.393 --> 00:44:49.937
(groans)

00:44:52.481 --> 00:44:54.942
(Screams)

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.443
(button press sound)

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.736
Huh...

00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:00.739
(Chirai) Are you okay?

00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:06.954
You're going too far!
Doing something like that

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:10.040
(Paragus) If you hadn't stopped him,
he might have been killed.

00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:13.919
What kind of upbringing did you have?

00:45:14.002 --> 00:45:17.548
Hmm, he's my benefactor, but
it seems we don't get along.

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:20.676
Please stay away from my son from now on.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.845
Damn...

00:45:22.928 --> 00:45:24.513
- (Chilly) Chit
- (Paragas) Hun

00:45:26.014 --> 00:45:29.852
(Very Bright) Paragus,
Lord Frieza is calling for you.

00:45:29.935 --> 00:45:32.521
Lord Frieza?
Yes, I'll be there right away.

00:45:32.604 --> 00:45:33.439
Broly

00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:36.191
Paragus-san alone is fine

00:45:36.275 --> 00:45:38.444
Huh? Is that so?

00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:42.114
Broly will be here soon, just wait.

00:45:43.282 --> 00:45:47.077
Even my dead shitty dad
might be better than him

00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:48.746
-(Cheerai) Hehehe-
(Remo) Huh?

00:45:49.872 --> 00:45:52.750
Hmph hee hee...

00:45:53.292 --> 00:45:55.085
Oh, did you steal it?

00:45:55.794 --> 00:45:58.213
I'll do it like this

00:46:03.218 --> 00:46:05.971
Broly, thank you for earlier.

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.019
(Broly) Ah, ah...

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:15.564
(Remo) What
? Do you want some water? Let me borrow some.

00:46:19.318 --> 00:46:20.277
Here

00:46:24.406 --> 00:46:25.324
Huh?

00:46:26.366 --> 00:46:27.910
What is this?

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:30.662
(Chirai) Huh? It's just water.

00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:33.665
Have you
never even drunk water?

00:46:40.088 --> 00:46:41.089
Huh...

00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:45.636
It was delicious

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.557
This is my grandmother's ear

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:53.852
Oh, you mean the fur?

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:57.523
(Broly)
I was good friends with Granny.

00:46:58.357 --> 00:47:03.153
Baa is a big, big
beast, bigger than this ship

00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:06.240
I called it that because it cries "baa"

00:47:07.407 --> 00:47:08.784
Baa is scary

00:47:08.867 --> 00:47:14.331
Every day I trained to avoid Baa's attacks

00:47:15.624 --> 00:47:17.334
We became good friends

00:47:18.126 --> 00:47:19.962
We became very close friends.

00:47:22.256 --> 00:47:24.174
(Granny cries)

00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:26.009
Hehehe

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:30.055
Is this your first friend?

00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:33.058
But my father was angry

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.104
When you get close to your grandma,
it's not training

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:38.105
So…

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:44.862
Dad shot Grandma in the ear with a gun
and made her mad.

00:47:45.445 --> 00:47:49.116
Grandma
never became friends with me again

00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:54.580
So I
decided to stay with Grandma's ears

00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.127
You talked a lot, Broly.

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:04.506
This is the first time I've heard such a pure story here.

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:08.343
You're so pure

00:48:08.927 --> 00:48:12.889
Maybe you
don't really like fighting

00:48:12.973 --> 00:48:14.016
yeah…

00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:17.352
(Remo) Because he had incredible fighting talent

00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:20.981
My dad forced me
to train him

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:22.441
(Chirai) Your father.

00:48:23.275 --> 00:48:27.571
Maybe they just see you as a powerful weapon ?

00:48:27.654 --> 00:48:29.531
For revenge and promotion

00:48:30.115 --> 00:48:33.785
I guess
your dad is the worst

00:48:34.369 --> 00:48:37.122
You don't need to listen to what that guy says

00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:43.629
It's not good to speak ill of your father

00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:47.007
(Cheerai and Remo sigh)

00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:50.177
(radar sound)

00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:51.762
(Radar noise)
(Frieza soldier)
It should be around here...

00:48:51.845 --> 00:48:54.097
Woohoo!

00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:56.642
You idiot! Get out of here quickly!

00:48:56.725 --> 00:48:57.809
(Frieza Soldier) Sorry.

00:49:02.814 --> 00:49:04.024
- (Frieza Soldier) Ah-
(Frieza Soldier) Huh?

00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:07.361
There it is, there it is!

00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:12.658
(Frieza)
To the planet called Earth that we are going to

00:49:12.741 --> 00:49:15.661
There's Vegeta and
another Saiyan.

00:49:15.744 --> 00:49:18.872
I'll show you Broly's power .

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:23.126
Broly's strength is that
of a natural born genius

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.337
I'll clear my long-held grudge

00:49:26.088 --> 00:49:29.967
By the way , you can like Vegeta if you like.

00:49:31.677 --> 00:49:35.222
The final blow for another
Saiyan , Son Goku,

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:37.307
Please leave it to me

00:49:37.891 --> 00:49:39.851
Killing Son Goku

00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:43.188
That's been my dream for a long time!

00:49:44.439 --> 00:49:46.274
Understood

00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:50.404
Lord Frieza!
It seems all seven Dragon Balls have been collected.

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:52.531
Oh that's great!

00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:06.628
(Bulma) Huh? Over there!
It's Frieza's army.

00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:09.881
Tch, you've already found the last one

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.802
(Frieza Soldier)
Isn't that plane dangerous?

00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:17.097
I don't think he's the Saiyan Kikono-sama was talking about .

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.808
Ugh

00:50:19.891 --> 00:50:22.185
Wow, this is lonely

00:50:22.894 --> 00:50:24.813
(Bulma)
I'm surprised Whis is okay.

00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:27.733
(Whis) It's much colder in space .

00:50:27.816 --> 00:50:30.444
(Scouter measuring sound)

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:31.361
(unmeasurable sound)

00:50:31.445 --> 00:50:34.656
(Frieza Soldier) Oh no... This is bad
. My scouter readings are way off the charts.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.284
It's a Saiyan! Let's run!

00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:40.871
(Everyone) Huh?

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:43.373
(Frieza soldiers) Wow!

00:50:48.086 --> 00:50:51.298
Hey, come on!
Come out and give me back my Dragon Balls!

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.632
Hmph

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.468
Wha... what should we do?

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:57.804
What... what should I do? I have to give it back.

00:50:58.305 --> 00:51:00.140
This guy will kill me

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.978
Ugh... If I give it back,
Frieza will kill me

00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:07.063
- (Goku) Huh?
- (Vegeta) Hmm?

00:51:14.362 --> 00:51:15.197
(Frieza) Huff

00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:29.920
Oh dear, here comes Frieza

00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:31.963
Huh? What?

00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:35.008
It's not just Frieza

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:38.053
Something outrageous...

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:56.947
(Frieza soldiers) Wow!

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:06.456
(Vegeta) Huh?

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.627
Aren't they Saiyans?

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.879
(Paragus) Hmm? Hmm...

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:17.300
Hmm? Vegeta!

00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:19.052
no doubt

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.890
He looks just like the king.

00:52:28.103 --> 00:52:30.272
(Goku) What are you doing here, Frieza?

00:52:30.355 --> 00:52:32.899
You already know, right?

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:35.944
To make wishes come true with the Dragon Balls

00:52:39.072 --> 00:52:40.157
Hehehe

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.118
(Chirai)
What's that ball-like thing?

00:52:43.201 --> 00:52:46.121
(Remo) Come on
, ask someone.

00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:50.417
Hey!
Give me back my Dragon Balls!

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.211
It seems like that's not the case.

00:52:53.795 --> 00:52:57.424
Should we say that this is the nature of a warrior race?

00:52:58.216 --> 00:53:00.177
(Goku) Frieza Who are those two?

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.680
This is
the newest addition to Frieza's army.

00:53:03.763 --> 00:53:06.933
Broly and his father...

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:08.768
(Paragas) It's Paragas.

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:10.228
It seems that

00:53:10.312 --> 00:53:14.524
As you can see,
I'm a Saiyan just like you.

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.401
I don't know anybody like that.

00:53:16.484 --> 00:53:20.655
(Frieza) When you were a child,
Broly and Paragus

00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:25.493
Your father, King Vegeta,
treated me badly.

00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:31.124
Apparently, until now, they have been unable to escape from this unfamiliar, harsh planet.

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:38.590
Frieza

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:42.510
What is Kakoku?

00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:43.428
(Vegeta) Ugh

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:48.391
That's too strict.

00:53:48.475 --> 00:53:50.769
Hehehe... Thank you

00:53:50.852 --> 00:53:51.853
You idiot

00:53:52.437 --> 00:53:57.317
Damn... I
'll never forgive you, Vegeta

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.735
yeah?

00:53:58.818 --> 00:54:01.279
We came to get revenge

00:54:01.363 --> 00:54:02.739
Damn...

00:54:03.323 --> 00:54:05.951
(Vegeta)
Don't mess with me. Who cares?

00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:07.744
(Goku) That has nothing to do with it.

00:54:07.827 --> 00:54:11.706
We're both Saiyans,
so let's get along

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:15.335
Grrrr... Grrrr...

00:54:16.002 --> 00:54:17.212
Lord Frieza

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:20.674
(Growl)

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:24.678
It seems you can't stand it.
That's fine.

00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:28.181
Please show me how powerful you are

00:54:29.182 --> 00:54:30.558
I've got it

00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:34.104
Okay Broly, do it!

00:54:34.187 --> 00:54:36.940
(roar)

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:40.777
Ha!

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:41.695
(Vegeta) Hmph

00:54:51.746 --> 00:54:54.332
Woohoo ha!

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:56.960
You did it!

00:54:57.043 --> 00:55:00.380
My body is finally warming up! Ha
!

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.978
(Vegeta) Fast!

00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:18.440
Are you learning how to use your power?

00:55:18.523 --> 00:55:19.607
Haa!

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.737
(Combat sounds)

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.532
Vegeta
seems to have trained quite a bit as well.

00:55:27.615 --> 00:55:30.952
They've
been through a lot of hell.

00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:34.581
It seems you're not used to it yet

00:55:35.707 --> 00:55:39.419
Broly, you
've never fought a human before, right?

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.671
(Paragus)
The simulation and I...

00:55:41.755 --> 00:55:44.090
(Frieza)
With your fighting power...

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:46.092
It makes little sense

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.803
Don't worry

00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:51.181
I'm gradually getting used to it

00:55:51.264 --> 00:55:52.682
(Broly/Vegeta) Guh!

00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:00.523
(Broly) Ah!

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:05.653
Good job Broly

00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:08.907
(Both) Hmph! Hmph!
Aaah!

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.328
(Two groans)

00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:16.414
(Broly) Ggh ggh ugh!

00:56:16.498 --> 00:56:18.541
What an annoying guy!

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:21.002
- (Vegeta) Oh no!
- (Broly) Argh!

00:56:28.802 --> 00:56:30.178
- (Vegeta) Hmph!
- (Broly) Argh...

00:56:30.261 --> 00:56:36.935
Haaaah...

00:56:37.018 --> 00:56:40.522
Aaah!

00:56:40.605 --> 00:56:41.523
Ah...

00:56:47.987 --> 00:56:50.448
Wh... what is that!

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:54.327
Oh, you can't become Broly ?

00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:55.912
To Super Saiyan

00:56:55.995 --> 00:56:59.416
S... Super Saiyan?

00:56:59.499 --> 00:57:02.043
Could it be a legendary one?

00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:09.467
(Growl)

00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:13.638
Wow

00:57:14.889 --> 00:57:16.015
Gwah!

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:36.119
Wh... what is this thing!

00:57:36.202 --> 00:57:39.080
(Broly) Guwaaaah!

00:57:39.164 --> 00:57:40.373
(Vegeta) Ugh!

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:44.419
It's growing fast!

00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:47.547
(Broly) Aaaahhh!

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:52.969
(Screams)

00:57:54.596 --> 00:57:56.931
- (Broly) Aaah!
- (Vegeta) Ah! Ah...

00:57:58.141 --> 00:58:00.018
(Broly) Guaah!

00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:08.610
(Goku) What an amazing guy!
He's fighting on equal terms with his natural state.

00:58:11.404 --> 00:58:12.405
Hmm!

00:58:20.914 --> 00:58:22.081
Haa!

00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:24.709
Ugh...

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.171
Ah... ah...

00:58:31.591 --> 00:58:33.718
Ugh ugh ugh...

00:58:34.385 --> 00:58:37.388
Brrrrrrr...!

00:58:41.935 --> 00:58:44.062
Hah hah hah!

00:58:44.145 --> 00:58:46.272
Haaaah!

00:58:49.442 --> 00:58:50.610
Ggh!

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:55.698
Whaa ...

00:59:01.496 --> 00:59:05.708
Ve... I can't believe Vegeta's
skills have improved this much...

00:59:05.792 --> 00:59:07.961
Oh, are you at your limit yet?

00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:10.547
Yes... Yes

00:59:11.339 --> 00:59:13.132
Well, that's fine.

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:16.636
Shall we withdraw for today ?

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:17.679
yes…

00:59:17.762 --> 00:59:20.223
Ughhhhhh...

00:59:23.184 --> 00:59:24.602
Hmm? What?

00:59:24.686 --> 00:59:26.896
(Broly) Rrrrr...

00:59:27.772 --> 00:59:32.026
No... No.
Broly, that's all for today!

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:35.405
Stop it! Come back!

00:59:35.989 --> 00:59:39.200
(Broly) Grrrr... ugh

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:45.540
Ah! It's not happening.

00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:48.918
There's no remote control...

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:51.879
Broly!

00:59:51.963 --> 00:59:54.382
I'm telling you to stop!

00:59:54.465 --> 00:59:57.802
(Broly) Ugh...

00:59:57.885 --> 01:00:02.140
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:03.308
Huh!

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:06.102
Stupid

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:10.231
Ah, stop it, Vegeta!

01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:15.111
Ugh ugh wow!

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:25.997
Huh!

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:30.960
(Broly) Ugh...

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:33.838
Hmm?

01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:39.927
Woah!

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:53.191
(Vegeta) Ahh

01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:01.407
(Broly roars)

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.827
Woohoo!

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:06.412
(Vegeta/Goku) Wow!

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:07.830
Are you kidding me? Wow

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:08.748
(Vegeta) Huh?

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.750
Have you ever seen a Saiyan like that?

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:14.420
Hey, did you bring the Senzu Beans?
Kakarot

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.588
(Goku) I didn't bring it.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.342
This is no time to play around

01:01:19.425 --> 01:01:24.138
(roar)

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:32.605
(strained voice)

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:35.692
Aaaahhh!

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.111
(Goku) Wow

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:48.162
Oh no, if that
had hit the ground...

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:50.206
Ugh... aah

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:52.417
And here we go!

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.043
Huh!

01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:59.048
(Goku) Vegeta!

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.682
What is that?

01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:09.183
Ah... that's...

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.979
The power a Saiyan
has when he turns into a Great Ape

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.481
Without becoming a lumbering giant monkey

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:19.318
Apparently they made it so that you could transform while remaining human.

01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:19.902
Apparently they made it so that you could transform while remaining human
(Great Ape Roar)

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:20.945
(Great monkey roars)

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:22.697
Is there a problem?

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:24.866
That's...

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:26.242
yeah?

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:31.664
It seems I can't control myself ...

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.083
Gwaaaahh!

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.168
(Vegeta) Gwah

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.465
Damn it!

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.302
Grrrr...

01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:46.012
- (Goku) Hey you!
- (Broly) Hmm?

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.226
Let's do it together soon

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.233
(Growl)

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:03.946
(Goku) Ho ho ho ho...

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:12.205
Hmm!

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.372
(Broly) Mmm!

01:03:14.248 --> 01:03:16.459
Ugh...

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:20.505
(Goku) Hmph!

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:25.718
(strained voice)

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.470
Haaah!
(sound of collar shattering)

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.818
- (Broly) Aaaah!
- (Goku) Yaaaah!

01:03:54.288 --> 01:03:55.289
(Goku) Aah!

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:05.550
(Goku) Guaaaah!

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:10.721
(Goku) Wow, wow...

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:12.431
Wow!

01:04:13.474 --> 01:04:16.435
(Broly)
Yeah haaaa!

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:21.524
(Goku) Guaaaah!

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:29.615
(roar)

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.829
Damn... Nurryah!

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:37.623
Haaaah!

01:04:38.624 --> 01:04:40.501
(Broly) Aaaahhh

01:04:59.103 --> 01:05:00.271
Yay!

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.152
(Broly) Aaah!

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.903
Wow... Woahhh!

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:09.405
(Broly) Ah!

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.828
Here we go!

01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:28.758
(roar)

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:32.470
Hehe

01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:34.013
(Broly) Woah!

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:38.017
Hah hmph!

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.355
(Broly) Here it is!

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.149
Yay!

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.401
Wow ugh!

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:50.529
Hey, calm down

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:54.241
(roar)

01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:57.995
Grrrrr!

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.289
(Goku) Mmm! Huh!

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:01.374
(Broly) Aaaahhh

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.500
(Goku) Haa!

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:03.834
Gugh!

01:06:04.585 --> 01:06:05.544
(Goku) Ugh...

01:06:07.254 --> 01:06:11.300
We are here...
living peacefully on this Earth.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:15.846
Ngh aaahhh!

01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:19.266
Well, a lot of things.

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:22.228
There was.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.066
Guwaaaah!

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.694
(Goku) Anyway
, you're not a bad guy.

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.612
I know that

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.739
(Broly) Ugh... Ah...

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.449
(Goku) Stop doing this

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:38.202
I won't listen to what the bad guys say

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.913
(Frieza) Hehehe...

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:48.295
(Screams)

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:49.296
Damn

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:53.217
(Broly) Aaaahhh

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:56.554
(Goku) Ugh...

01:06:56.637 --> 01:06:58.305
(Broly) Ugh!

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:00.725
Aaaah!

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:03.352
(Goku) Uwah grrrrr!

01:07:04.645 --> 01:07:07.565
Teryaaaaa!

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:08.649
(Broly) Wow!

01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:13.696
- (Bulma) Whoa!
- (Whis) Oh my, oh my...

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:16.073
(Chillai Remo) Wow

01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:21.495
(Kikono) Lord Frieza!
Can we step away for a bit?

01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:24.582
That seems better.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:28.294
Gugaaaah!

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:32.798
I definitely got the Dragon Balls !

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:37.720
Now, I have no worries

01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:40.765
You can see your son in action .

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:41.974
(Paragus) Huh?

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:43.851
Grrrr

01:07:43.934 --> 01:07:47.354
(Screams)

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:54.487
(Goku/Broly) Woah!

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:04.789
Here we go!

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:05.873
a…

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:10.294
He was that amazing
...

01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:14.632
But that's not normal.

01:08:14.715 --> 01:08:15.674
ah…

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:20.012
(Broly) Ah! Ah!
Guaaaahh!

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.264
It's that dad's fault

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.391
ah…

01:08:25.726 --> 01:08:26.769
(Goku) Guaah!

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:29.563
(Chirai)
Forcing the meek Broly

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:32.942
It's the result of raising him to be the warrior I wanted.

01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:36.278
Is that what made him angry?

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:40.825
What a poor guy

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:44.829
(roar)

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.081
Ah, if this continues...

01:08:47.748 --> 01:08:51.127
I'll be killed by Broly

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:55.089
Ah... it's over

01:08:55.172 --> 01:08:57.675
Wow!

01:08:57.758 --> 01:08:59.135
Wow

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:08.894
(strained voice)

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:11.021
Here we go!

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:13.774
Whoa?

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.987
Wow!

01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:20.573
Guaaaahh!

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.575
- (Broly) Hmph!
- (Goku) Ahh!

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.244
Aaaahhh!

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:27.788
(Screams)

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.207
(Broly) Yaaaaah!

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:34.545
Guaaaahh!

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:41.844
- (Broly) Teryaaah!
- (Goku) Aaaaah!

01:09:43.637 --> 01:09:45.973
(Broly) Aaahhh!

01:09:46.056 --> 01:09:48.475
(Goku) Gugigigi...!

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:04.033
Ahh... aaahh...

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:07.077
Guaaaahh

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:11.373
(roar)

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:16.837
Oh dear, Lord Frieza
doesn't have a role to play here.

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:23.719
(Piccolo) Hmm?

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:25.971
- (Broly) Aaaah!
- (Goku) Ugh...

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.723
- (Piccolo) Son!
- (Goku) Ha!

01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:30.851
What happened?

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:33.354
Frieza isn't the only one with this feeling.

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:36.774
(Goku) Ah... yeah... I guess so.

01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:39.485
It looks like you're busy

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:42.196
Ugh... ugh!

01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:44.114
That's it...

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:46.325
(Piccolo) That's outrageous.

01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:50.454
If I go, I'll probably just be a hindrance...

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.457
(Goku) Just wait there.

01:10:58.253 --> 01:11:01.799
If things get bad,
I'll teleport there.

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:03.092
Ugh...

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:05.761
(Growl)

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:09.682
Ugh... Ah ha ha...

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.976
(Piccolo)
I can't believe you said that.

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:13.936
He's quite the opponent.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.022
Ugh... hehehe...

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.274
See you later

01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:23.821
(strained voice)

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:27.908
Grrrrr!

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:32.371
Nnnnn!

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:36.292
(Screams)

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:37.418
Damn...

01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:39.962
Ahhhh!

01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:42.631
Uuuuh

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:47.011
Aaaahhh!

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:50.431
Haaaah!

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:01.442
(strained voice)

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:05.654
(Broly) Hey there!

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:42.358
(Broly) Aaahhh!

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:44.193
Yay!

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:47.071
(Goku) Wow!

01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:49.364
(Paragus) Hmm...

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.117
Wow!

01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:05.047
(Goku) Here we go!

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.049
Hey...

01:13:07.132 --> 01:13:08.467
Mmmmm!

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.177
(Goku) Yes!

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.387
(Paragus) Ugh... Ugh...

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.306
Maybe...

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:19.812
Was what King Vegeta said
correct?

01:13:28.612 --> 01:13:31.532
(Broly) Guwaaaah!

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:38.038
Is there nothing more this time ?

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:39.206
(Paragas) Yes...

01:13:39.289 --> 01:13:41.583
(Frieza) I see.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.131
Shall we try it?

01:13:49.466 --> 01:13:50.884
(Frightened voice)

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:51.927
(Frieza) Huff

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:53.804
(Paragus) Wow...

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.057
(clears throat)

01:13:57.558 --> 01:14:00.853
Broly! Look at this!

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:03.897
- (Frieza) Broly-san!
- (Broly) Huh?

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:07.025
My father has been murdered!

01:14:08.318 --> 01:14:09.444
(Broly) Ah!

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.615
Guaaah...

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:17.453
Aaaahhh!

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:22.082
Uh ah uh ahh

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:28.589
(Screams)

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:31.008
Ugh!

01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:34.428
Guaaaahh!

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:56.158
(Broly) Aaaahhh!

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:03.498
Yay! It was a success!

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:06.376
(strained voice)

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.669
(Goku) Damn...

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:13.967
(Screams)

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:21.183
Aaaahhh!

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.483
(Frieza) Hmmmm...

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:32.402
Haaaah!

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:34.488
Dararyaryaryarya!

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:35.948
Ha ha ha!

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:40.744
(Broly) Ngh~ Guaah!

01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:42.913
(Goku) Damn...

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:48.543
Hmm!

01:15:50.837 --> 01:15:54.633
(Frieza) That's nice.
I've been waiting to see you like that.

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:55.842
Damn...

01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:59.638
What are you doing, you idiot!

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.936
This is not the time to be so hung up on one-on-one

01:16:06.019 --> 01:16:08.939
(Goku) It's frustrating, but that seems to be the case.

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:11.358
(Vegeta's strained voice)

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:25.455
(Goku) Let's do it, Vegeta!

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.126
(Vegeta) Damn it!

01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:30.377
Garlic Gun!

01:16:30.877 --> 01:16:33.922
Kamehameha... Waves!

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:35.007
(Broly) Yaaaah!

01:16:45.892 --> 01:16:47.603
Oh wait!

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:49.813
I'm Frieza!

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:54.192
(Frieza)
Ugh ugh ugh...

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.029
(Goku) Vegeta,
come over here now!

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:58.280
Wh... what?

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.661
Hey, what the hell is going on?

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:06.580
(Goku) Ugh... Ugh...

01:17:06.663 --> 01:17:08.290
(Vegeta) Ugh, let go

01:17:08.832 --> 01:17:10.417
Hurry up, we'll talk later

01:17:11.251 --> 01:17:13.378
Piccolo, do you have a Senzu Bean?

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:14.921
(Piccolo) No, I don't have one.

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:16.673
Huh...?

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:21.803
Hey Vegeta
, do you know what a fusion technique is?

01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:23.472
Fusion?

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:27.309
Ah, that reminds me,
I heard it from Trunks.

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:30.896
Hmm, is this a silly move to
combine?

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:34.191
Ah, fusion! Let's do it.

01:17:34.274 --> 01:17:35.525
(Vegeta) Don't mess with me!

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:38.111
I'll never merge with you!

01:17:38.695 --> 01:17:40.489
Only 30 minutes

01:17:41.114 --> 01:17:43.367
Didn't they combine with Potara before?

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:45.869
The Potara isn't here.

01:17:45.952 --> 01:17:48.789
The only way
to beat him is to fuse

01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:51.166
(Vegeta)
The fusion was inevitable.

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:55.253
Are you asking me to do this, this, this kind of movement ?

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.255
(Goku) Without this, there's no way to win.

01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:00.133
The Earth might disappear
.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:02.636
(Vegeta) Hmph
, then that must be fate.

01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:07.682
Would it be okay if my beloved Bulma
died?

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:11.603
Ha... Don't say something embarrassing.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:12.938
Tch

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:16.441
I... I get it. Just tell me.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.068
- (Broly) Ahh!
- (Frieza) Guh

01:18:18.735 --> 01:18:20.904
(Kicking sound)

01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:26.201
(Frieza) Nu... Ugh!

01:18:26.284 --> 01:18:30.288
Nuuuuuuuuuuuuu

01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:34.084
(Broly) Waah!

01:18:34.626 --> 01:18:36.878
(Frieza) How dare you do this to me?

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:39.506
You've made it this far

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:44.970
For you,
the power of Golden Frieza is

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:47.013
Let's teach them a lesson!

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:49.725
(Goku and Piccolo)
Fusion!

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:51.393
Ha!

01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:54.354
What an
embarrassing pose

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:56.273
This is fusion

01:18:56.356 --> 01:18:58.900
I don't have time,
so let's practice

01:18:59.776 --> 01:19:01.403
What's wrong Vegeta?

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:04.656
Damn... I'd rather be dead

01:19:06.616 --> 01:19:09.286
(Goku and Vegeta)
Fusion!

01:19:09.369 --> 01:19:10.495
Ha!

01:19:11.371 --> 01:19:12.747
nothing?

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.054
(Baekwoo)
Hehe, this is the best

01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:30.182
No, my fingers don't fit together.

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:32.601
Again in 30 minutes.

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:33.602
Great!

01:19:33.685 --> 01:19:35.103
- (Broly) Ah!
- (Frieza) Guh!

01:19:38.982 --> 01:19:41.067
Aaah!

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:45.113
(Goku and Vegeta)
Fusion! Ha!

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.532
Hmm?

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:49.826
Uh... Uh...

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:54.372
It's no good at all.
The angles of the two are slightly different.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.750
It's another 30 minutes later

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:58.835
Ahhhh!

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:00.045
(Frieza) Guwaaa!

01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:05.425
(Goku and Vegeta)
Fusion! Ha!

01:20:06.259 --> 01:20:07.677
yeah!

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.147
Huh

01:20:25.028 --> 01:20:27.697
Okay, go and kill him now.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:31.618
Um...
what should I call you?

01:20:31.701 --> 01:20:35.664
(Goku/Vegeta) Eh?
Wasn't it Vegito during the Potara ?

01:20:35.747 --> 01:20:37.249
Well then, um...

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:39.167
(Piccolo) That's enough, just go

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:40.919
(Goku/Vegeta) That's not the case.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:44.047
It would definitely
be cooler if it had a name

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:47.551
This time, um...

01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:49.845
(Gogeta) It's Gogeta

01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:51.805
Hmph!

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:57.102
(strained voice)

01:20:57.185 --> 01:21:00.063
Ugh... Ugh...

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:04.818
Amazing
, what amazing fighting power!

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:08.863
Hmm? What is it?

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:11.491
(Gogeta) Huh, I'm Gogeta

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:15.245
Goku and Vegeta combined

01:21:15.328 --> 01:21:16.746
Merge?

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:21.001
(Gogeta) You
just don't know because you've been dead for so long.

01:21:21.084 --> 01:21:23.712
It's not just the combined strength of the two of us.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.881
It's an even bigger increase

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:28.091
(Frieza) That's... so cowardly!

01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:31.928
You're not good at saying things like that.

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:36.641
(Whis) Phew, phew, phew

01:21:37.642 --> 01:21:39.102
This way

01:21:39.936 --> 01:21:41.021
Here you go

01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:43.315
fault?

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:45.650
Whis,
leave the rest to me.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:46.943
Grrrr

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:50.655
(Whis) You guys
can combine, huh?

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.033
Ah, fusion.

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:57.287
Grrrr...

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:58.538
come!

01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:04.586
(Broly) Whoa!

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:17.432
(Gogeta) Heh

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:22.604
(Broly) Ah!

01:22:24.814 --> 01:22:26.191
(Gogeta) Let's go!

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:32.030
- (Gogeta) Aaaah!
- (Broly) Aaaah!

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:33.281
Haa!

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:41.289
(Both) No, no...!

01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:50.548
- (Gogeta) Aah!
- (Broly) Argh!

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:51.466
(Broly) Wow...

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:57.263
(Gogeta's strained voice)

01:22:58.264 --> 01:22:59.307
Taaaaah!

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:02.769
Ugh... Ugh...

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:06.189
Guaaaahh!

01:23:06.272 --> 01:23:08.608
(Gogeta) Yaaaah!

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:10.860
(Broly) Guaaaah!

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:13.405
Whew!

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:19.786
Haaaah!

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:38.680
(Gogeta) Ah!

01:23:38.763 --> 01:23:41.641
(Broly) Aaaahhh!

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.727
(Sound of dimensional wall breaking)

01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:51.484
(Gogeta) Da-da-da-da...!
Ah!

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:55.113
Aaaahhh!

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.032
(Gogeta) Here it is!

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:58.074
(Broly) Ugh!

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:01.661
(Gogeta) Guwah!

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.622
(Broly) Yeaaah!

01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:07.542
(Gogeta) Aaaahhh!

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:18.052
(Broly) Aaaah!

01:24:22.348 --> 01:24:23.475
(Gogeta) Yaaaah!

01:24:27.937 --> 01:24:29.731
(Both) Yaaaaaah!

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:35.904
Guuuuuugh

01:24:35.987 --> 01:24:38.865
(Growl)

01:24:40.033 --> 01:24:40.867
Hehe

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:43.745
At this rate
Broly will be killed

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:48.875
Because of his father, he
was turned into just a fighting machine

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.711
I'm not fighting because I want to fight

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:56.758
Broly
is truly a pure and kind-hearted Saiyan.

01:24:56.841 --> 01:24:58.259
I can't let you die

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.678
(Remo) Wow, wow, wow...!

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:04.224
Guaaaahh!

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:07.519
- (Broly) Ah!
- (Gogeta) Ha!

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.938
(Broly) Guh Gaaahh!

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:13.608
- (Gogeta) Ah!
- (Broly) Guaaaaah!

01:25:13.691 --> 01:25:14.734
Ugh... Ugh...

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:15.944
(Gogeta) Hmph

01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:19.072
Ugh... Grrr...

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:23.034
Haaaah!

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.621
Yay!

01:25:26.704 --> 01:25:27.747
Haa!

01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:33.753
Ha! Ha!

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:35.421
(Broly) Waah!

01:25:37.757 --> 01:25:40.426
Haaaah!

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:43.263
Urya rya rya...!

01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:46.766
(Screams)

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:49.102
(Gogeta) Mmm!

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:50.645
Haa!

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:54.107
(Broly) Guaaaah!

01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:56.025
Phew...

01:25:59.696 --> 01:26:00.864
yeah?

01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:10.456
a…

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:18.047
(Shenron) I'll grant you one wish, no matter what it is.

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:20.175
(Chirai)
So what should I do?

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:21.676
Say it quickly

01:26:21.759 --> 01:26:23.678
(Kikono) Gugigigi...

01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:25.221
Enough, shoot.

01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:27.724
I... I understand.

01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:32.395
Just say your wish

01:26:32.478 --> 01:26:35.231
What, that's all?

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:39.611
My wish is...

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:42.780
(Broly) Grrrrr

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:49.412
(roar)

01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:53.458
Haaaah!

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:54.417
Wow!

01:26:55.418 --> 01:26:58.922
- (Gogeta) Aaaah!
- (Broly) Guaaah!

01:26:59.005 --> 01:26:59.881
(Gogeta) Hmph

01:27:02.008 --> 01:27:04.594
Haaaah!

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:06.930
(Gogeta) Huh

01:27:12.268 --> 01:27:13.770
Whew!

01:27:15.104 --> 01:27:16.230
So here it is!

01:27:20.151 --> 01:27:21.819
- (Gogeta) Yes!
- (Broly) Ugh...

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:29.369
Haaaah!

01:27:31.162 --> 01:27:33.831
(Broly) Argh! Uuuuh...

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:35.959
Hmph! Yaaaah!

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:37.961
Whew!

01:27:42.548 --> 01:27:44.926
Guh uaaaahh!

01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:49.889
Good morning!

01:27:49.973 --> 01:27:52.058
- (Gogeta) Haaah!
- (Broly) Guaah!

01:27:52.141 --> 01:27:56.479
Yaaaah! Taaaah!

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:03.945
Mmm! Taaaaah!

01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:14.038
wonderful!

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:18.459
This
might be the end of it

01:28:19.043 --> 01:28:20.169
Hmm...

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:25.883
(Gogeta) Huh...

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:28.261
Meh...

01:28:28.344 --> 01:28:30.471
Sigh...

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:32.056
Meh...

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.350
(Broly) Ahh... ahhh...

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:39.022
Waves aaaah!

01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:46.362
(Broly) Ahh... Ugh...

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:51.868
Send Broly back to his planet!

01:29:09.218 --> 01:29:11.304
(Broly) Ugh, ahhh

01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:14.057
Ah... ahh

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.768
(Shenron) Your wish has been granted

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:19.937
Farewell

01:29:27.945 --> 01:29:28.780
(Gogeta) Hmph

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:36.204
(Kikono Chirai) Ah...

01:29:37.246 --> 01:29:38.581
Get on board, Cheelai!

01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:43.503
(Kikono) Huh?

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:54.680
(Gogeta) Oops! Hehe

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:57.058
Hmm...

01:30:02.438 --> 01:30:03.439
Hmph

01:30:05.983 --> 01:30:07.777
I'll come again

01:30:14.325 --> 01:30:15.368
Huh

01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:18.454
(Bra's excited voice)

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:23.167
(Beerus) Yeah, it
looks like it worked out.

01:30:29.549 --> 01:30:32.969
(Chirai) Sorry for
dragging you into this.

01:30:33.052 --> 01:30:34.595
Don't worry

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:39.142
Since joining Frieza's army, this
has been the most thrilling and fun experience.

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:42.478
(Chirai) I wonder if he'll come after me?

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:44.939
Well then

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:48.734
So where is Cheelai going?

01:30:49.485 --> 01:30:51.028
Broly's planet

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.363
Bumper?

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:55.324
(Cheerai) On which planet will Remo land?

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.077
No, I'll join you too

01:30:58.578 --> 01:31:01.497
No matter where you are, the danger is the same

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:05.668
It would be safer to be near a strong Broly.

01:31:05.751 --> 01:31:08.671
Wow wow wow...

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:13.843
Well , I'll have to buy some food and other things along the way.

01:31:15.094 --> 01:31:16.596
(Kikono)
As expected, those two

01:31:16.679 --> 01:31:18.806
It's like being with Broly

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:22.810
(Frieza)
Let's let it swim like that for a while.

01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:26.063
I'll leave Broly's mind control to those two.

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.024
Without losing myself

01:31:28.107 --> 01:31:31.277
If we could unleash that incredible power,

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.530
That will make you the strongest fighter

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:36.991
Will it work?

01:31:38.618 --> 01:31:41.287
I hope that's the case.

01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:47.168
No matter how hard I try
to improve my fighting power...

01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:50.004
The enemies are Son Goku and Vegeta

01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:56.844
I want at least one more person here too

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:59.222
Hehehe...

01:32:02.391 --> 01:32:04.393
(Scruffing sound)

01:32:12.652 --> 01:32:13.778
yeah…

01:32:15.821 --> 01:32:18.991
You're kidding me, you were eating something like this?

01:32:20.618 --> 01:32:21.452
Ugh...

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:25.373
Well, it's bitter, but
it's better than starving to death.

01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:28.793
(licking noise)

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:31.546
(Remo) No
... I can't do it.

01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:33.339
(Chirai)
Don't be so extravagant.

01:32:33.422 --> 01:32:36.676
The food we bought
won't last us 50 days.

01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:38.928
(Broly) Huh?

01:32:39.595 --> 01:32:40.763
Someone came

01:32:40.846 --> 01:32:41.764
Huh?

01:32:41.847 --> 01:32:44.267
(Goku) Hey, can I come in?

01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:45.977
(anxious voice)

01:32:48.104 --> 01:32:50.773
Huh? Who are you guys?

01:32:50.856 --> 01:32:53.442
(Chirai)
You... you're a Saiyan from Earth!

01:32:54.443 --> 01:32:57.822
Ah, that's right,
it was Frieza's army that used the Dragon Balls!

01:32:58.948 --> 01:33:00.366
What are you here for?

01:33:03.369 --> 01:33:05.329
Was he Broly's friend?

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.665
(Remo) I'm asking you what you came here for.

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:09.583
Well, don't get so worked up

01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:12.545
I didn't come here to fight.

01:33:12.628 --> 01:33:13.796
So what?

01:33:13.879 --> 01:33:18.884
I heard it was a terrible planet, so
I brought some things.

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:21.595
That's none of your business. Go home.

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:23.097
Because I won't be fooled.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.557
Hahaha...

01:33:26.976 --> 01:33:30.438
I got this from a guy named Bulma .

01:33:31.897 --> 01:33:34.900
Move aside for a moment. Here you go.

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:39.238
(Remo Chirai) Huh...

01:33:39.322 --> 01:33:43.826
(Goku) There's a lot of water, food, and other things in the house.

01:33:44.702 --> 01:33:45.995
(Remo) Oh~

01:33:47.913 --> 01:33:50.416
(Goku)
And this is called a Senzu Bean.

01:33:50.499 --> 01:33:51.751
Take two pills

01:33:51.834 --> 01:33:54.628
It's good to eat when you feel like "Oh no, I'm going to die."

01:33:55.212 --> 01:33:56.756
I can't afford to be sick

01:33:56.839 --> 01:34:00.092
If you have an injury, it will be completely healed
and your stamina will be full.

01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:02.678
What are you up to?

01:34:03.262 --> 01:34:05.181
It's not like that

01:34:05.264 --> 01:34:07.058
Just stay healthy and alive.

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:08.184
(Remo Chirai) Huh?

01:34:08.267 --> 01:34:11.562
I was confident that I was strong.

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:14.815
A much stronger
Broly appears

01:34:15.691 --> 01:34:17.401
Moreover, we are both Saiyans.

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:20.196
He's probably stronger than Beerus.

01:34:20.279 --> 01:34:20.988
Lord Beerus is
a god though

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:22.239
Lord Beerus
is a god
(Beerus sneezes)

01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:23.616
Lord Beerus is
a god though

01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:24.075
Lord Beerus is
a god, you
know (Whis)

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:24.658
(Whis) Oh.

01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:28.704
Anyway, I can't die from such an amazing person.

01:34:29.372 --> 01:34:30.623
Isn't that a waste?

01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:39.840
Well, whatever. Take care.

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:41.842
well!

01:34:41.926 --> 01:34:44.178
(Remo) Huh? There's no spaceship.

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:46.389
How did you get here?

01:34:46.972 --> 01:34:50.810
I can teleport,
I'm searching for Broly's energy

01:34:50.893 --> 01:34:54.605
I still don't understand what you're saying

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:56.273
Can I come again?

01:34:56.357 --> 01:35:00.027
I'm telling you,
we are your enemies.

01:35:00.611 --> 01:35:02.863
The Frieza Army might be fired, though.

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:05.324
I won't be your friend

01:35:06.158 --> 01:35:08.035
It doesn't matter

01:35:08.619 --> 01:35:09.453
(Cheer) Huh?

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:13.749
(Goku) I
just want to fight Broly every once in a while.

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:15.000
(Chirai Remo) Huh?

01:35:15.084 --> 01:35:18.671
There are some things I'd like to teach you .

01:35:19.505 --> 01:35:22.466
You seem pretty crazy.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:23.968
Why?

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:27.596
Well, I'll say thank you for now

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.848
Thank you

01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:31.851
Okay, see you later.

01:35:32.476 --> 01:35:34.729
He might not be here anymore.

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:39.316
It's okay, if it's not too far I can find it

01:35:42.027 --> 01:35:44.155
What's your name?

01:35:47.658 --> 01:35:49.076
孫悟空

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:50.995
And—

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:53.747
Kakarot

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.885
♪～

01:39:35.177 --> 01:39:40.182
～♪
